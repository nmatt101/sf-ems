7.12 Adult and Pediatric Vascular Access with Intraosseous (IO) Device

INDICATION

•  Cri�cally ill or injured pa�ents

o  Cardiac arrest or impending arrest
o  Severe Hypotension with profound shock and poor perfusion;
o  Acute deteriora�ng level of consciousness.

If vascular access cannot be established via peripheral IV in 2 atempts or less than 90 seconds
(in scenarios listed above), then proceed with either IO or see protocol  7.13 Vascular Access
with Pre-Exis�ng Vascular Access Device

•

CONTRAINDICATION

•  Fracture to bone and/or splint distal to inser�on site;
•  Prior orthopedic procedure (total knee or shoulder replacement) or amputa�on;
•  Previous IO atempt in same extremity;
•  Pre-exis�ng condi�on aﬀec�ng extremity such as burns or infec�ons;
•  Pa�ent is not cri�cally ill or injured

PROCEDURE

1.  Choose either site:

a.  Humeral Head

i.  Place pa�ent’s hand over umbilicus on chosen side
ii.  Place IO about 1 cm above the neck of humerus and at a 45-degree angle

to the anterior plane and posteromedial

OR

b.  Proximal Tibia

i.  Landmark 2-3 cm below �bial tuberosity on anteromedial ﬂat bony

surface at a 90-degree angle

2.  Assemble needed equipment
3.  Prep site with approved asep�c technique
4.  Insert the IO needle:
a.  Humeral Head

1.  Hold the arm steady.
2.  Place the IO about 1 cm above the surgical neck of the humerus
3.  Grasp the needle with the obturator s�ll in place and gently press needle through
the skin un�l the �p touches the bone. The 5 mm black mark must be visible
above the skin prior to inser�on. Squeeze the trigger and apply gentle steady

pressure insert it through the skin at the selected site at a 45-degree angle to the
skin surface.

b.  Proximal Tibia

1.  Hold the leg steady.
2.  Grasp the needle with the obturator will in place and insert it through the skin at

the selected site at a 90-degree angle to the skin surface.

5.  When a needle is felt to ‘pop’ or have lack of resistance into the bone marrow space:

a.  Remove the obturator.
b.  Atach a syringe with 0.5mg/kg of 2% Lidocaine solu�on (max dose 50 mg) and

slowly ﬂush the IO needle in pa�ents who are conscious.

c.  Atach a <10 mL syringe containing IV solu�on, to ﬂush the IO needle 120

seconds following lidocaine administra�on.

d.  Remove the obturator; atach a primed IV solu�on set with or without a stop

cock.

6.  If unable to ﬂush, con�nue procedure and watch carefully for extravasa�on and swelling

while infusing ﬂuids and/or medica�ons

7.  Secure the needle, catheter hub to skin, and immobilize extremity
8.  If inﬁltra�on occurs or needle is removed, stop the infusion, remove the needle, and

apply a pressure bandage to the IO site. If another IO will be atempted, use a diﬀerent
bone.

a.  Remove IO by ataching syringe to needle hub and ﬁrmly pulling straight out from

site
