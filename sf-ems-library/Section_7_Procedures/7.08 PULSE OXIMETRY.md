7.08 PULSE OXIMETRY

INDICATION

•  Any patient that presents with respiratory compromise

PROCEDURE

1.  Ensure any nail polish is removed, if possible.
2.  Place probe on finger. Pediatric finger wraps may be used on pediatrics.
3.  Target O2 saturation 94-95%. Supplement Oxygen via nasal cannula (2-6 L/min) for

awake, oriented, stable patients without evidence of hypoperfusion or 100% high flow
via nonrebreather mask (10-15 L/min) if indicated.

NOTES

•  Some inhalational poisonings, such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide, may

result in patients with normal oxygen saturation readings, but cellular hypoxia due to
displacement of the oxygen molecule from the hemoglobin in red blood cells.
•  Pulse oximetry may overestimate SpO2 in patients with darker skin. Signs and

•

symptoms of hypoxia should be considered to guide therapy.
In all of the above cases, maximal Oxygen therapy should be delivered to the patient
regardless of pulse oximeter reading if the patient has signs of respiratory compromise.
