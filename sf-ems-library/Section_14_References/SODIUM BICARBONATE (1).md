SODIUM BICARBONATE

ACTION:  Alkalinizing Agent
•  Acts as a buffering agent when administered to neutralize hydrogen ions resulting in carbon

dioxide as a byproduct.

•  Alkalinization of blood results in shifting of potassium into the intracellular space, lowering

serum potassium levels.

INDICATIONS:
•  Known or suspected hyperkalemia
•  Cardiac arrests associated with tricyclic antidepressants or hyperkalemia.
•  Crush syndrome

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
•  None

 POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
•  Hypotension
•  Headache and flushing
•  Syncope
•  Fluid overload
•  Tachycardia
•  Alkalosis

ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
  Suspected Hyperkalemia:50mEq IV/IO one time dose
  QRS widening (QRS>100) from Tricyclic Antidepressant Overdose: 50mEq IV/IO. Repeat q5

min until ECG changes improve (QRS<100) and/or to a total of 150 mEq.
  Crush Syndrome:1mEq/kg (max 50mEq) push immediately prior to extrication.

PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  Suspected Hyperkalemia: 1mEq/kg (max 50mEq) IV/IO one time dose. If <2 years dilute 1:1

with sterile water.

  QRS widening from Tricyclic Antidepressant: 1mEq/kg IV/IO, (max of 50mEq per dose).
Repeat q5 min until ECG changes improve (QRS<100) and/or to a total of 150 mEq. If <2
years, dilute 1:1 with sterile water.

  Crush Syndrome: 1mEq/kg (max 50mEq) push immediately prior to extrication. If <2 years,

dilute 1:1 with sterile water.

 NOTES: Thorough 20 cc IV/IO flush before administration of other medications to avoid
precipitation.
