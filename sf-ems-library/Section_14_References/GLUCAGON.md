GLUCAGON

ACTION:  Hormone/Antihypoglycemic
•  Glucagon is a hormone secreted by the pancreas that causes a breakdown of stored glycogen
into glucose and stops glucose conversion into glycogen resulting in increased circulating
blood glucose.

•  Glucagon is only effective if there are sufficient stores of glycogen in the liver.
•  Used in treatment of beta blocker overdose; likely mechanism of action is the increase of

cAMP in the myocardium.

INDICATIONS:
•  Hypoglycemia when an IV cannot be established to administer D50W.
•  Patients given Glucagon usually take from 5 to 20 min. to return to consciousness.
•  Bradycardia and Hypotension secondary to Beta Blocker Overdose (with Base Hospital

Contact).

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
•  Hypersensitivity to Glucagon.

POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
•  Hypotension.
•  Dizziness and headache.

•  Nausea and vomiting.

  Hypoglycemia / Beta Blocker Overdose: 1 mg IM/IV

PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  Hypoglycemia/Beta Blocker Overdose:
Less than 20kg: 0.5 mg IM/IV
Greater than 20kg: 1 mg IM/IV

NOTES:
•  Vomiting is very common following glucagon administration
•  As soon as patient is awake, give carbohydrates such as orange juice or a meal.
