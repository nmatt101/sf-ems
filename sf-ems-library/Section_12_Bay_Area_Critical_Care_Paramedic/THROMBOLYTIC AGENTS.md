THROMBOLYTIC AGENTS

1. PURPOSE

To authorize CCP’s to monitor and discontinue, as needed, thrombolytic agent infusions

2. POLICY

2.1. Precautions

Large stroke with NIH Stroke Scale score > 22 as reported by sending facility

•
• CT shows evidence of large middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction

2.2. Function - Thrombolytic agent
2.3. Circumstances under which CCPs may perform thrombolytic infusion:

•
•

Interfacility transports
Infusion must be initiated prior to departure

2.4. Setting - Interfacility CCP transports

• A thrombolytic agent is not to be given without written orders from the referring physician.

These orders must be specifically followed.

• CCPs must verify that a neurologic exam has been completed prior to administration
• Supervision: The transferring physician must be present at patient’s bedside or  by

telemedicine when facility initiated thrombolytic infusion

2.5 Patient Conditions Patients with signs and symptoms of acute ischemic stroke

3. PROCEDURE

3.1. Definition: Thrombolytic agents are plasminogen activators that convert the zymogen

plasminogen to the active enzyme plasmin, which degrades fibrin.

3.2. Subjective: Any symptoms communicated by the patient.
3.3. Objective:

• Acute ischemic stroke onset within 4.5 hours of drug administration.
• Measurable deficit on NIH Stroke Scale examination as reported by sending facility. The

Cincinnati Stroke Scale or EMS agency approved scale can be utilized in transport to monitor
patient status.

• Patient’s CT scan does not show intracranial hemorrhage or non-stroke cause of deficit.

3.4. Diagnosis: Acute ischemic stroke confirmed by physician examination and CT scan.
3.5. Plan:

• To monitor thrombolytics: receipt from the transferring physician of specific orders for the

continuation of thrombolytic infusion, including remaining dose, route, and time of
administration must be obtained.
If a thrombolytic has been given, or is being administered upon CCP arrival, it is imperative
that blood pressure parameters are obtained from the transferring physician.

3.6. Discontinue infusion immediately if any of the following occur:

• Acute worsening of neurologic signs/symptoms
• Decline in the level of consciousness
• New onset of headache
• Nausea and vomiting
• Sudden acute rise in blood pressure
• Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage

3.7. Thrombolytic Agent Dose:

• Dose widely varies based on thrombolytic agent ordered by physician and below are common

medications/doses for reference only. Administer per transferring physician orders only.

o TNKase: a one-time, weight based IV bolus with a range of 30-50 mg.
o Alteplase/tPA: 0.9 mg/kg (max dose of 90 mg) given over 60 mins with 10% of the

total dose given initially as a bolus over 1 min.

o Reteplase: 10 units IV over 2 mins and repeat dose in 30 mins.
o Streptokinase: 1,500,000 units infused over 60 mins.
