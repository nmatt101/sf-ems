LOCAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES INFORMATION SYSTEM (LEMSIS)

I.

 PURPOSE

The Local EMS Information System (LEMSIS) serves as the central repository of EMS data
using standardized data elements and indicators for system-wide monitoring and evaluation of
patient care in the San Francisco EMS System.

II.  AUTHORITY

A.  Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Section 164.512 (b) (l) (i)
B.  California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1797.220
C.  California Code of Regulations, Title 22,  Section 100172
D.  Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Section PART 164, Subpart E, Sec. 164.512 (b,i)

III. REFERENCE

A.  EMSA #164 California EMS Information System Data Dictionary
B.  NEMSIS (National EMS Information System, NHTSA Version 2.2.1 Data Dictionary

IV. POLICY

A.  Patient Care Documentation Standards

1.  The provider Patient Care Record (PCR) must contain all data fields listed in
Appendix A.
2.  A SF EMS Agency approved Patient Care Record (may be paper or electronic) shall
be completed for all patient contacts, including:

a)  Transported patients
b)  Non-transports
c)  Patients treated and released at special events, including when released to

event medical staff (refer to Mass Gathering Policy 7010)

3.  For prehospital births, a separate PCR must be completed for the mother and each
newborn.
4.  PCR’s shall be completed immediately after each call whenever possible, and must be
completed prior to going off duty.

a)  A copy of the PCR will be provided to the receiving hospital prior to leaving

the facility unless the unit is needed for another emergency call.
(1) If required for another emergency call, the PCR will be provided to the
facility prior to going off duty, or within 24 hours, whichever is earlier.

5.  PCR’s must be completed for all patients during MCI. Triage tags are not considered
an acceptable substitute for a PCR.  Patient tracking information will be included on the
PCR.

B.  Data Collection and Reporting

Page 1

Policy Reference No.:  6010
Effective Date:  August1, 1, 2008

1.  Dispatch and Ambulance providers shall collect all data elements as defined by this
policy, in Appendix A in a format defined by the EMSA and in accordance with
standards established the National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) and California
EMS Information System (CEMSIS).
2.  Hospital providers shall report hospital outcome data elements from the Hospital data
systems.
3.  Providers shall train all personnel involved in collecting data on the purpose of the
LEMSIS, the LEMSIS data elements definitions (Appendix A), and data sources as
defined in this policy.
4.  Providers shall collect, organize, and validate the LEMSIS data elements.
a)  Provider QI plans shall include method for validation of data accuracy
b)  Validation method is subject to approval by the EMS Agency Medical Director
5.  Providers may use electronic, manual or scanned patient records for data collection;

however, data must be in an electronic format meeting EMS Agency requirements for
submission.

C.  Data Transfer

1.  Providers using hard copy PCR’s shall transmit all LEMSIS data for each month to
the EMS Agency no later than 45 days after the end of that month.
2.  Providers using electronic PCR’s shall transmit all LEMSIS data and an electronic
copy of the PCR to the EMS Agency according to deadlines established by the EMS
Agency.
3.  Data will be in an electronic form that is importable to the EMS Agency data system.
4.  Each provider shall have a HIPAA compliance protocol that addresses data security
during transfer to the EMS Agency.
5.  The EMS Agency abides by the San Francisco Department of Public Health HIPAA
compliance protocol as it pertains to the transfer and receipt of EMS data for LEMSIS.
6.  Investigators of EMS research studies who request data from LEMSIS must have
approval by an Institutional Review Board prior to submitting their request to the EMS
Agency (refer to Research Studies Policy 6030).

D.  Retention of Data

1.  The EMS Agency shall maintain the LEMSIS data repository and establish
procedures for retention and secure storage of LEMSIS data.

E.  Data Reporting and Analysis

1.  The LEMSIS Steering Group provides technical expertise and oversight of
data collection, analysis, and reporting as it relates to quality improvement
activities. The LEMSIS Steering Group will be comprised of quality improvement
representatives from the EMS Agency, each ambulance provider, the Base
Hospital, and the Department of Emergency Management, Division of Emergency
Communications. The LEMSIS Steering Group will meet on a quarterly basis and
be responsible for the following functions:

a)  Oversee development and implementation of locally and state determined

EMS system indicators for evaluation

b)  Maintain responsibility for collecting and evaluating data for reporting to

the EMS Advisory Committee on state required and optional EMS System
indicators

Page 2

Policy Reference No.:  6010
Effective Date:  August1, 1, 2008

c)  Provide recommendations to the EMS Advisory Committee and EMS

Agency Medical Director on benchmarking and best practices based upon
analysis of EMS System Quality Indicators.

2.  EMS System Quality Indicators are determined using LEMSIS data elements,
Base Hospital data, Trauma Center data, and EMS Agency certification and
accreditation data.
3.  The EMS Agency shall produce a quarterly EMS System report of EMS
System Quality Indicators for review at the EMS Advisory Committee.
