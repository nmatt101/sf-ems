If presenting fetal part is anything other
than the head, initiate transport
immediately. Need for surgery.

Allow newborn to deliver unassisted.
When the legs are delivered, support
newborn body and wrap in towel, but do
not provide any traction.

After shoulders spontaneously deliver,
gently elevate trunk and legs to aid in
delivery of head (infant face down).

If presenting fetal part is

Can not be delivered in field.
Transport immediately.

Unable to
deliver?

Place gloved hand in vagina, and position
fingers on either side of neonate's nose
and mouth to make a "V" to allow
airflow to fetal mouth until the head
delivers. Keep the fetal neck flexed.

Comments

•  Not all breech presentations can be delivered vaginally, quick

transport for potential surgical intervention is critical.

•  Allowing spontaneous delivery of fetus up to level of umbilicus

increases cervical dilation, decreasing risk of fetal head entrapment.

Nuchal Cord

BLS Treatment

•  Once fetal head is delivered, check for the presence of a cord around fetal neck.

•

•

•

If nuchal cord noted, hook finger between nuchal cord and fetal body and attempt to reduce
by slipping cord over head.

If multiple nuchal cord loops are noted, reduce one at a time.

If unable to reduce, deliver fetus with nuchal cord around neck.

Shoulder Dystocia
BLS Treatment

•

Instruct mother to stop pushing immediately.

•  Perform McRoberts Maneuver: Hyperflex mother’s hips (knees pressed firmly to patient’s

chest) by first provider with second provider applying suprapubic (not fundal) pressure with
fist directed downwards with third provider providing gentle downward traction on fetal
head.

•  Transport should be initiated immediately with communication of concern for “shoulder

dystocia” in ring down report.

Comments

•  Shoulder dystocia is when the fetal shoulder becomes wedged behind the pubic bone.
•  Clinically, fetal head noted to retract back after progressing forward known as the “turtle

sign.”

Breech Delivery
BLS Treatment

If presenting fetal part is anything other than head, initiate transport immediately. Need for
surgery. Do not delay transport.

•  Allow newborn to deliver unassisted. When the legs are delivered, support newborn body
and wrap in towel, but do not provide any traction. After shoulders spontaneously deliver,
gently elevate trunk and legs to aid in delivery of head (infant face down).
If head does not deliver with next contraction, place gloved hand in vagina, and position
fingers on either side of the neonate’s nose and mouth to make a “V” to allow airflow to
fetal mouth until the head delivers. Keep the fetal neck flexed.

Comments

•  Not all breech presentations can be delivered vaginally, quick transport for potential surgical

intervention is critical.

•  Allowing spontaneous delivery of fetus up to level of umbilicus increases cervical dilation,

decreasing risk of fetal head entrapment.

Prolapsed Cord
BLS Treatment

If prolapsed cord visualized:
•  Gently displace presenting part of fetus off cord and maintain displacement to achieve
pulsatile cord blood flow. DO NOT pull or over-handle cord in order to prevent cord
compression and spasm.

•  Cover visible portion of cord with sterile gauze moistened with warm Normal Saline (to

prevent cord spasm and premature delivery).

•  Rapid transport in Left lateral Trendelenburg position.
•  Do NOT reposition or switch providers maintaining displacement. If provider, such as

midwife, has already displaced fetus off cord they should maintain position and transport
with patient.
