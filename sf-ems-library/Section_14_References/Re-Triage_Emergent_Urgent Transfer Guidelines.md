Paramedic

Paramedic  Stable

(E.g. non-emergent
cardiac cath lab)

(CCT –RN or

May need blood pressure
and respiratory,
monitoring and support
(E.g. intracranial
hemorrhage on
clevidipine drip)

IV locked

Scope of Practice Includes*
•
•  O2 cannula or mask
•

Equipment: nasogastric tube, gastric tube, foley catheter, patient-
controlled device (e.g. insulin pump)
•
IV fluids (e.g. LR/NS)
•  CPAP. No ventilator.
•  Cardiac monitoring
•
•  Medications: all meds permitted in local scope of practice except

Equipment: chest tube water seal, arterial line capped

no IV pump infusion
Intubated stable ventilator settings, BIPAP, high flow

•
•  Cardiac monitoring, blood pressure monitoring
•

Equipment (CCT-RN only): transvenous pacer, arterial line,
intracranial pressure line, mechanical circulatory support
(Impella®, Intra-aortic balloon pump, ECMO)

•  Medications: titratable IV medications

9-1-1
Advanced Life
Support (ALS)

Paramedic  Same scope of practice as ALS above

Patient type: stabilized patient with time sensitive emergency requiring definitive treatment.

Includes: Emergent Trauma

•
•  May include: STEMI Activation, Stroke/LVO, OB emergency

* If medications /interventions exceed the EMS scope of practice an extended service provider
(MD/NP/PA/RN) must accompany the patient.
 9-1-1 EMS resources are only indicated when appropriate interfacility transportation is not available quickly
enough for a time sensitive emergency.

Sending Physician responsibilities:

•  Provide medical screening exam and treatment to stabilize patient prior to transfer.
•  Maintain responsibility for determination of patient stability and clinical appropriateness for transfer.
•  Confirm receiving hospital has space, resources available and accepting qualified physician.
•  Certify that the patient understands the risk and benefits of transfer or in cases of emergency

transfer, the benefits of a transfer outweigh the risks.

•  Assure that an appropriate vehicle, equipment and level of personnel is used in the transfer.
•  Anticipate patient’s needs during transport if clinical deterioration occurs.
•  Provide detailed patient care instructions to EMS personnel appropriate to their scope of practice

and patient condition (see Table 1). This may include blood pressure parameters, patient positioning
etc.
If possible, send the patient’s medical record (including medications administered, relevant
pertinent diagnostic tests, DNR forms etc.) and personal belongings with the patient

TRAUMA RE-TRIAGE/EMERGENT

URGENT TRAUMA TRANSFER REQUEST

Table 2: Urgent Versus Emergent Trauma

1.  Provide immediate lifesaving interventions
(airway management, hemorrhage control,
decompress tension pneumothorax, etc.)

2.  Call 9-1-1 and request an EMERGENCY

RESPONSE

3.  Call ZSFGH at (628)206-8111 to notify the ED

4.

Attending in Charge (AIC)
If possible, send the patient’s medical record (e.g.
paramedic records, emergency department
records, images, lab tests) with the patient but
this should not delay transport. Delayed records
must be faxed to BOTH:

a.  ZSFG Emergency Dept at (628) 206-9176.
b.  ZSFG Trauma Services Administration at

(415) 206-4079

URGENT TRAUMA SPECIALTY
FOLLOWUP
1.  Follow local specialty outpatient
referral processes to establish
patient follow-up.

1.  Call SFGH at (628)206-8111 and discuss
with ED Attending in Charge (AIC) patient
status.

2.  These patients may require additional

3.

diagnostic procedures to evaluate injuries
prior to transfer acceptance.
If transfer accepted, arrange for transport
appropriate to patient’s condition
according to EMS Scope of Practice
4.  Prepare patient records and results of any
imaging studies and send with the patient.

•
•

Intracranial hemorrhage
 3 or more rib fractures and/or pulmonary
contusion with significant oxygen
requirement

•  Solid organ injury confirmed by U/S or CT

•

scan
 2 or more long bone fractures; suspected
crush injury or compartment syndrome
•  Any pregnant trauma patients (>20 weeks).

•  Uncomplicated tympanic
membrane perforation
