BLS Treatment

•  Assess circulation, airway, breathing, and responsiveness.
•

If patient is unresponsive, oxygen therapy to include high flow oxygen and positive pressure
ventilation as needed.
If patient remains unresponsive despite oxygenation and positive pressure ventilation, begin
CPR at 15:2.

•

•  Continue Oxygen with appropriate airway adjuncts If patient is responsive after oxygenation

but still symptomatic.

•  Support ABCs, observe and frequent reassessments.
•  Treat underlying reversible causes.

ALS Treatment

IV Normal Saline TKO, preferably at antecubital fossa.
If unstable, IO if unable to establish an IV.

•  Advanced airway if indicated.
•
•
•  Epinephrine 0.01mg/kg IVP/IO (0.1mg/mL) maximum single dose 1mg OR
•  Atropine if suspected increased vagal tone or primary AV block 0.02 mg/kg IVP/IO. Minimum

dose 0.1mg, maximum single dose 0.5mg

•  Consider Transcutaneous pacing if refractory to medications.
•
•  Consider Normal Saline bolus if hypotensive. Neonate: 10mL/kg IV/IO. May repeat up to

If agitated during TCP and not hypotensive, may administer Midazolam.

30mL/kg. Pediatric: 20mL/kg IV/IO. May repeat up to 60mL/kg. See Pediatric Cardiac Arrest
protocol 8.07 if pulses are not present

Comments

SYMPTOMATIC BRADYCARDIA DEFINITION: Pulse rate < 60 BPM and any of the following:
•  Unresponsive
•  Hypotension.
•  Signs of shock/hypoperfusion.
•  Acutely altered mental status, syncope or near syncope.

REVERSIBLE CAUSES: Hypoxia, Hypothermia, Toxins/medications* Hydrogen ion,
Hypovolemia, Hypokalemia, Hyperkalemia, Hypoglycemia, Tamponade (cardiac) Tension
pneumothorax, Thrombosis (pulmonary), Thrombosis (cardiac)
