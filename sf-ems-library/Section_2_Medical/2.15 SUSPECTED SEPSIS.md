Comments

•  Sepsis is caused by a whole-body inflammatory response called, “Systemic Inflammatory

Response Syndrome “characterized by a fever (not always present), tachycardia, tachypnea
and hypotension. It is more common in the very young (newborns), the elderly, diabetics or
those with compromised immune systems. Other risk factors include: cancer/malignancies,
renal disease, alcoholism, drug abuse, malnutrition, hypothermia or recent surgical or other
invasive procedures (e.g. long-term venous catheters placed).  Field treatment is early
recognition, fluid and notifying hospital staff about possible sepsis.
