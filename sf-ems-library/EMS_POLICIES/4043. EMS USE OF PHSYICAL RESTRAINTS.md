2.7.1.  EMS personnel shall frequently assess the pa�ent to ensure that the restrained

pa�ent’s airway is patent, distal limb circula�on is adequate, and that restraints can be
released quickly should the pa�ent require cardiopulmonary resuscita�on.

2.7.2.  Airway and suc�on equipment shall always be available for the restrained pa�ent. EMS

personnel shall never leave the restrained pa�ent unatended.

2.7.3.  Pa�ents shall not be placed in the prone at any point during restraint or transport. If
pa�ent is prone upon arrival, pa�ent shall be placed in a supine posi�on upon
assuming care.

2.8.   EMS personnel shall always seek assistance from the appropriate public safety agency to

assist with securing the scene as delineated in EMS Agency Policy 4041 Scene Management.
EMS personnel shall request addi�onal personnel to safely restrain the pa�ent.

2.9.  If a comba�ve pa�ent aggressively breaks away (escapes) from EMS personnel, the pa�ent
shall not be pursued or subdued if they do not represent an immediate threat to the EMS
provider.

2.10. Law Enforcement is the appropriate public safety agency to secure the scene and assure safety

in the ﬁeld. (Refer to EMS Agency Policy 4041 Scene Management).

2.11. All EMS personnel shall receive training by their individual employer in the use of de-

2.12.1. So� restraints: The primary physical restraint device used in the prehospital se�ng.

restraints. Restraints should not be secured to moveable parts such as rails or levers
unless the restraint cannot otherwise be safely accomplished, and only when the
manufacturer’s guidelines allow for ataching so� restraints to moveable parts of the
gurney. EMS personnel shall have a method to rapidly remove restraints should airway,
breathing, or circula�on be compromised such as seatbelt cuters or shears.
2.12.2. Gurney or spine board straps (Velcro, Buckle): Should be used to supplement the so�

restraints. The strap across the chest shall not be over �ghtened to the extent that
over�ghtening interferes with adequate ven�latory mo�on of the chest wall muscles
and diaphragm.

2.12.3. Long back board or ﬂat: The pa�ent may be secured to a long back board or ﬂat then

placed on a gurney for transport.

2.12.4. Spit sock: The pa�ent is spi�ng or verbalizes intent to do so.
2.12.5. C-collar: To maintain c-spine protec�on and minimizes ﬂexion of the neck to prevent a
pa�ent from bi�ng an EMS provider. Use with cau�on if placement of c-collar
interferes with ability to monitor pa�ent’s airway.

airway control.

2.13.  EMS personnel are not authorized to place a pa�ent in hard plas�c �es (temporary or riot
