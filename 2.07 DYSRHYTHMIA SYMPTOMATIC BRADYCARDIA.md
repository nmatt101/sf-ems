BLS Treatment

Posi�on of comfort. Supine/semi-fowlers preferred in absence of diﬃculty breathing.

• Call for ALS resources if BLS resource

ALS Treatment

Current American Heart Associa�on Guidelines concerning Emergency Cardiac Care
assessments and interven�ons shall always take precedence over local protocols when
there is a conﬂict concerning techniques of resuscita�on.

•   Cardiac monitor, and iden�fy rhythm
•  12-lead EKG. If symptoma�c, do not delay therapy in order to obtain 12 lead.
•
Start IV or IO
•
Atropine 1mg IVP/IO
•
If the heart rate <50 BPM, but hypotension persists:  Normal Saline ﬂuid bolus.
•  If Atropine is ineﬀec�ve, or if rhythm is suspected to be not vagally mediated: Epinephrine
Infusion  :Infuse 1-3 drops per second IV/IO and apply “stand by” pacing pads

•

Transcutaneous Pacing (TCP) as needed for con�nued unstable bradycardia.

•  Strongly consider seda�on with TCP, may administer Midazolam :5 mg IM or 5mg slow IVP

Comments
Symptoma�c bradycardia deﬁned as a heart rate <50/min, with any one or more of the
following:

•

•

o Hypotension
o Acute altered mental status
o Ischemic chest discomfort
o Acute heart failure

Follow Protocol 2.17 Hyperkalemia if bradycardia is suspected to be from hyperkalemia
(e.g., bradycardia, peaked T waves, or prolonged QRS (>.12 sec), sine wave)
Follow protocol 2.10 Poisoning and Overdose for suspected medica�on causes.
See Destination Policy 5000 for transport decisions.
