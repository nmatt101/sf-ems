Subject: EMS Alert Suspension ReddiNet Banner - NEW Feature

On May 22, 2023, an EMS Alert suspension banner feature was added to ReddiNet as frequently
requested by hospitals.

Background: EMS Alert is suspended when the sum of hospitals on Diversion, Trauma Override, or EMS
Alert is equal to or greater than 5. When EMS Alert is suspended, hospitals might receive additional
ambulance transports above their designated ratio each time EMS Alert is suspended. As EMS Alert is
very fluid and changes minute by minute, EMS Alert suspension is triggered frequently. As such,
hospitals occasionally receive ambulances above their ratio. Hospital have provided feedback in
requesting a visual for when EMS Alert is suspending over a period of time versus a scenario when an
ambulance bypasses EMS Alert.

New Feature: ReddiNet has added a feature that will display a banner “Facility Advisory: “EMS Alert” is
intermittently suspending due to system volume. Crews will be guided by status displayed at time of
transport.” As EMS Alert suspension fluctuates minute by minute, the banner will automatically trigger
for a period of time regardless of whether EMS Alert Suspension criteria continues to be met. This is
for awareness to hospitals to expect the possibility of additional ambulances above their designated
ratio as EMS Alert is going in and out of suspension.

Action Steps for DEC/Field Providers: ****DEC Dispatchers and Field Providers can ignore this banner
when present. This banner does NOT need to be communicated over the air as Field Providers do not
need to take any additional steps. DEC and Field providers must continue to follow all lit EMS Alert

“pills”

 regardless if EMS Alert banner is present.****

Diversion suspension is not affected by EMS Alert or the new EMS Alert Suspension hospital awareness
banner. Diversion suspension banner remains unchanged and should be broadcasted over the air if
requested.

If you have any questions or want to request additional training for your agency or facility, please feel
free to reach out the EMS Agency.
