BLOOD/BLOOD PRODUCTS

1. PURPOSE

To authorize CCP’s to monitor existing blood/blood product infusions during transport

2. POLICY

2.1. CCP’s are permitted to monitor/infuse blood and blood products during interfacility transports.
2.2. CCP’s may not adjust blood/blood product infusions without specific transferring physician

parameters or base hospital physician consult.

2.3. Use of a buddy light or other warming measure is preferred.

3. ADVERSE REACTIONS

3.1. Hemolytic Reactions: The most life-threatening and manifestations may vary considerably as:
fever, headache, chest or back pain, pain at the infusion site, hypotension, nausea, generalized
bleeding or oozing from surgical site, or shock. The most common cause is from ABO
incompatibility due to clerical error or transfusion to the wrong patient. Chances of survival are
dose dependent; therefore, it is important to stop the transfusion immediately if a hemolytic
reaction is suspected.

3.2. Febrile Non-Hemolytic Reaction: Chills and fever with a rise from baseline temperature of 1o C

or 1.8 o  F.

3.3. Allergic Reaction: Characterized by appearance of hives, urticaria, and itching.
3.4. Anaphylaxis: May occur after administration of only a few ml’s of a plasma containing

component. Symptoms include coughing, bronchospasms, respiratory distress, vascular
instability, nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, shock, and altered mental status.
3.5. Volume Overload: Characterized by dyspnea, headache, peripheral edema, coughing, frothy
sputum or other signs of congestive heart failure occurring during or soon after transfusion.

4. PROCEDURE

4.1. Identify the patient and blood by checking the patient ID band against the blood/blood product

label and the actual order for name, blood type, unit identifying number, and expiration date.

4.2. Monitor the patient’s condition and vital signs before, during, and after blood product infusion.
4.3. Blood/blood products infusion parameters:

4.3.1.  Infusion will be through filtered blood tubing. Stable patients shall have blood infused via IV

infusion pump. Unstable patients may have blood infused via a pressure bag without a
pump.

4.3.2.  Infusion rate will occur within the parameters as defined by the transferring physician. No
other flow adjustments may be made by the CCP other than to discontinue the infusion in
the event of complications.

4.4. In cases of a suspected adverse transfusion reaction, discontinue the blood/blood product

infusion. Notify the transferring physician and/or base hospital. Treat  signs/symptoms per local
EMS agency protocol as needed. Keep blood/blood products and deliver with the patient for
possible testing.
