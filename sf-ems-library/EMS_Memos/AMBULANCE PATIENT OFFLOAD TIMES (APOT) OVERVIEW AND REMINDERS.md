Subject: Ambulance Patient Offload Times (APOT) Overview and Reminders

The EMS Agency, EMS Providers, Hospital, and Dispatch leaders continue to address ambulance patient offload
times and ambulance diversion. As the EMS Agency meets with key stakeholders and partners, some common
questions arise, and the intention of this memo is to provide clarification to the EMS System.

Medication Administration on EMS Gurneys by Hospital Staff:
Due to patient safety concerns, patients should not regularly receive medications by hospital staff on EMS gurneys
except under emergency treatment (e.g. seizure with immediate placement into a hospital bed). EMS personnel
may not be familiar with medications being administered, aware of side effects, and may not be within the scope
of EMS personnel scope of practice. If a patient needs to receive a medication and is on an EMS gurney, the
patient must be moved to a hospital treatment space. The APOT Diversion workgroup will be discussing lab draws
on EMS gurneys as a future agenda item and more information will be forthcoming.

Triage to Ambulance:
Upon arrival to hospital, patients shall be moved into Emergency Department. Patients cannot be removed from
ambulance, triaged, and placed back into the ambulance to wait on a treatment space or bed.

Notification to DEC regarding a triage delay:
EMS Personnel may communicate a triage delay to DEC only if patient is actively sitting on an EMS gurney and not
on hospital equipment.

APOT Metrics:

***Destination Patient Transfer of Care is the time at which patient is physically removed from the ambulance
gurney to hospital equipment***This is NOT at time of registration, triage, pre or post-triage and waiting for a
bed. APOT-1 does not measure an ambulance’s return to service (such as documentation, decontamination,
etc.).

The APOT-1 standard in San Francisco is 20 minutes, 90th-percentile. This means 90% of all EMS offloads must
occur within 20 minutes or less as described above to meet the standard. APOT-1 is not calculated by average,
median, or mean.

EMS Personnel Documentation:
To ensure highest quality of documentation accuracy within the ePCR

  Arrived at Destination time within ePCR should match time listed as listed in CAD.
  Patient Transfer of Care time within ePCR should be documented at the exact moment when patient is
physically removed from EMS gurney and onto hospital equipment. Facility shall sign ePCR at that
moment in time.

For any questions or concerns, please contact the EMS Agency.
