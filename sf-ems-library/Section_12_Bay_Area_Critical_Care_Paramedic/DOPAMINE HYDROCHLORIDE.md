DOPAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE

1. PURPOSE

To authorize CCP’s to initiate, monitor and adjust existing intravenous Dopamine infusions

2. POLICY

2.1. CCP’s are permitted to monitor and adjust Dopamine infusions.
2.2. CCP’s may not initiate Dopamine infusions without transferring or base physician consult.

3. PRECAUTIONS

3.1. Use caution in patients who may be volume depleted. Focus is on sufficient volume replacement

first.

3.2. Patients on Dopamine may experience tachydysrhythmias and treat as indicated.

4. PROCEDURE

4.1. Indications include cardiogenic and/or distributive shock. Norepinephrine is preferred first line

vasopressor over Dopamine.

4.2. For septic shock, Dopamine is used only as an alternative to Norepinephrine in a select group of

patients, specifically those with a low risk of tachyarrhythmias and absolute or relative
bradycardia.

4.3. Regulation of the infusion rate will occur within the parameters as defined by the transferring
physician, but in no instance, will rate changes be greater than 5 mcg/kg/min increments q 5
mins.

4.4. Typical concentration for Dopamine is 400 mg/250 ml D5W. Caution that double strength

concentrations do exist in some hospitals.

4.5. Typical Dopamine infusion dose range is 5-20 mcg/kg/min.
4.6. The maximum Dopamine dose is 20 mcg/kg/min in most circumstances.
4.7. In cases of severe hypertension, the medication infusion will be slowly titrated down and, if
necessary, discontinued and the transferring physician or base hospital physician notified.

5. ADMINISTRATION

5.1. CCP’s may initiate Dopamine infusions in conjunction with transferring or base physician consult.
5.2. Titrate to achieve a MAP of >65 mmHg or heart rate > 70 bpm depending on indication of use
