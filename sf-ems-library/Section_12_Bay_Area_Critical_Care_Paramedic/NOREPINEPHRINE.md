NOREPINEPHRINE

1. PURPOSE

To authorize CCP’s to initiate, monitor and adjust existing Norepinephrine infusions

2. POLICY

2.1. CCP’s are permitted to monitor and adjust Norepinephrine infusions during interfacility transports.
2.2. CCP’s may initiate Norepinephrine infusions with a physician consultation.

3. PRECAUTIONS

3.1. Use caution in patients who may be volume depleted.
3.2. Although Norepinephrine has a lower rate of dysrhythmias than Dopamine, patients on

Norepinephrine may still experience tachydysrhythmias.

4. PROCEDURE

4.1. Regulation of the infusion rate will occur within parameters as defined by the transferring

physician, or standing orders, but in no case will changes be greater than 5 mcg/min increments
q 5 mins.

4.2. CCP’s may titrate Norepinephrine by increments of 1-5 mcg/min q 5 mins as needed to achieve a

MAP > 65mmHg.

4.3. Typical Norepinephrine dose range is 2-12 mcg/min.
4.4. The maximum Norepinephrine dose is 30 mcg/min.
4.5. In cases of severe hypertension, the Norepinephrine infusion will be titrated down and, if

necessary, discontinued, and the transferring physician or base hospital notified.

5. ADMINISTRATION

5.1. Initiation should be considered for hypotensive shock states after ensuring adequate volume

repletion.

5.2. Norepinephrine is the first line vasopressor to initiate unless other orders received from the

transferring or base hospital physician.

5.3. CCP’s may initiate Norepinephrine infusions in conjunction with transferring physician or base

hospital consultation.

5.4. To mix infusion add 4 mg Norepinephrine in 250 ml D5W for a concentration of 16 mcg/ml.

Caution – always check concentration since can vary at each facility.

5.5. Initiate Norepinephrine infusion at 5 mcg/min and titrate to achieve a MAP > 65 mmHg or to a

target MAP per transferring or base hospital physician orders.
