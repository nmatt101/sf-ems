2.04 CARDIAC ARREST
ALL Cardiac Arrests – High Performance CPR

See Appendix 2 for High Performance Team Organization.

See Protocol 2.19 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) for patients with device.

Current Advanced Cardiac Life Support should be followed in conjunction with this
protocol/algorithm

Start CAB (compressions, airway, breathing) when patient is unconscious/unresponsive, not
breathing normally and no pulse is detected within 10 seconds.

Compressions
Do 5 cycles of chest compressions at 30:2 compression/ventilation ratio:
•  Push hard (at least 2”) and fast (100-120/min).
•  Allow complete chest recoil.
•  Minimize compression interruptions.
•  Next up team compressor is continuously checking quality of femoral pulse and is ready to

rotate to the compressor position at the end of the cardiac cycle (2 minutes).

•  Rotate compressors every 2 minutes or sooner if fatigued.
•

If transported with compressions ongoing and LUCAS device is employed (and no evidence
of spinal trauma) elevate head of gurney 30 degrees.

AED/Defibrillator
•  While CPR is in progress, turn on AED/defibrillator and apply pads (anterior posterior if

possible) and puck.

•  Shock on a 2-minute cycle.  Pre-charge AED/Defibrillator at 1:45 to get ready to deliver

shock at 2 minutes.

•  Minimize perishock pause to less than 5 seconds.
•  Change out rescuer on chest compressions during perishock pause.
•  After first 30 compressions, analyze rhythm. Clear patient and shock if indicated. Resume

compressions for another 2 minutes before next rhythm analysis.

•  Always resume chest compressions immediately after rhythm analysis or shock.
•  EXCEPTION:  If patient goes into VF/pulseless VT while monitored or attached to an AED or

•

•

defibrillator, a shock must be administered immediately.
If no shock advised, resume compressions for another 2 minutes before next rhythm
analysis/femoral pulse check.
If a shockable rhythm continues past the third shock, attach a second set of
defibrillator pads in a chest position to provide alternate vector defibrillation and

                                                                                    Page 1 of 7

2.04 CARDIAC ARREST
switch vectors, or attach a second defibrillator with a second set of defibrillator pads
as soon as one is available to provide alternate vector defibrillation.

Airway/Ventilation:
•  Open airway. Provide bag-mask ventilation. Pause compressions 2 seconds or less to

ventilate during 30:2.

•  Ventilate enough to cause chest rise.  Avoid excessive ventilation (too fast or too much

•

volume).
Inserts airway adjuncts as appropriate. Do NOT stop chest compressions during advanced
airway insertions.

•  Asynchronous ventilations every 6 seconds once advanced airway is in place or every 10th

compression

IV/IO Medications:
•  ALS provider obtains IV/IO access and gives medications as appropriate.

                                                                                    Page 2 of 7
