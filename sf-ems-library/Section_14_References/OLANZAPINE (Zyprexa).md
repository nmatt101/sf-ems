NOTES:

•  Caution use in patients >60 years of age
•  May cause prolonged QT interval. Caution in patients with known prolonged QT

syndrome or recent simultaneous use of other QT-prolonging drugs.
•  Avoid in patients known to be pregnant, regardless of gestational age.
•  Patients with known schizophrenia or bipolar disorder that are symptomatic (i.e. hearing

voices, paranoid thoughts) may benefit most for symptom management. May be
administered safely for undifferentiated agitation.

•  Monitor airway and sedation if concomitant CNS depressant use is suspected as

depressant effects may be enhanced.

•  Look alike; sound alike medications are defined as those medications when written or
verbally pronounced have the potential to lead to a medication error by mimicking the
appearance or sound of another medication. The drug names olanzapine and
ondansetron are similar enough to cause confusion. A second check of drug names
should be performed before administration.
