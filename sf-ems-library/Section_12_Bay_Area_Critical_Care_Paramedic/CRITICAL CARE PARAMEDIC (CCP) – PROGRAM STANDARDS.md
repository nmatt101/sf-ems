CRITICAL CARE PARAMEDIC (CCP) – PROGRAM STANDARDS

1.  PURPOSE

The Critical Care Paramedic Program has been developed to provide a means of transporting patients who
require, or who may require, care within the CCP Scope of Practice during care. CCP units may be used to
transfer patients from or to acute care facilities, scene calls, or other medical facilities approved by the EMS
Medical Director.

The local EMS agency authorizes and contracts with interested ambulance providers that meet the training,
staffing, equipment, and oversight requirements for providing this level of service and that agree to comply with
program standards. Program authorization may be denied or withdrawn for failure to comply with program
standards or failure to submit required fees.

3.  MEDICAL DIRECTION

Personnel assigned to a CCP unit work under the existing medical control system and follow local
EMS agency policies and procedures as approved by the EMS Medical Director.

3.1. CCP Scope of Practice

The CCP scope of practice includes the local EMS agency’s basic and local optional scopes of
practice for paramedics listed in the agency’s EMS protocols. In addition, CCP’s have an
expanded scope that includes the administration of medications and procedures as outlined in
the CCP Treatment Guidelines:

•  Set up and maintain thoracic drainage systems
•  Set up and maintain mechanical ventilators
•  Set up and maintain IV fluid delivery pumps and devices
•  Calcium channel blockers
•  Blood and blood products*
•  Fluid Administration
•  Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitors*
•  Heparin IV*
•  Nitroglycerin IV*
•  Norepinephrine*
•  Thrombolytic agents*
•  Maintain total parental nutrition*

*These medications are CCP basic scope of practice if the CCP has completed a Critical Care
Paramedic training program as specified in (Title 22, Ch.4, §100146(1)(S), §100155 (b)).

3.2. Transferring Physician Orders/Scene Medical Direction

3.2.1.  For interfacility transfers:

3.2.1.1.  Standing orders approved by the CCP provider’s Medical Director is the gold

standard of patient care

3.2.1.2.  When the transferring physician or base hospital physician is contacted, specific

orders must be based on skills and medication that are in accordance with the
local EMS agency’s CCP scope of practice

3.2.1.3.  Clearly written physician orders are preferred and must be uploaded into the

electronic patient care record (ePCR)

3.2.1.4.  Clearly written physician orders may be obtained from the hospital’s medication

administration record and uploaded into the ePCR

3.2.2.  In special circumstances (e.g., scene/private residence responses) verbal physician orders

may be written down and read back to assure clarity. Document physician orders in the
ePCR.

3.2.3.  When radio communications are not possible, the CCP will provide care per the local EMS
agency’s ALS protocols and CCP field manual treatment guidelines until radio contact can
be made with the base hospital physician.
