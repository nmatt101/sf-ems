SEDATION AND ANALGESIA

1. PURPOSE

To provide chemical sedation and analgesia for ventilator dependent and agitated patients

2. POLICY

2.1. CCP’s are permitted to administer chemical sedation and analgesia without transferring physician

or base hospital contact.

2.2. CCP’s are permitted to monitor, NOT initiate, Fentanyl, Midazolam, and Morphine infusions.
2.3. CCP’s may administer Fentanyl, Midazolam, and Morphine boluses.
2.4. Fentanyl, Midazolam, and Morphine will be used, as appropriate, for:

2.4.1.  Ventilator dependent and/or agitated patients requiring chemical sedation, analgesia, or

restraint due to agitation, restlessness, and/or anxiety that is compromising patient stability

2.4.2.  Patients requiring pain management
2.4.3.  Other objective patient considerations:

• Need for an invasive procedure
•
Increase in level of distress
• Change in vital signs
• Change in pulse oximetry and/or EtCO2
• Change in cardiac monitor

3. PROCEDURE

3.1. Ventilator Dependent and/or Agitated Patients
3.1.1.  Apply soft, four-point restraints if needed.
3.1.2.  Continuously monitor oxygen saturation, EtCO2, heart rate, blood pressure and GCS.
3.1.3.  Focus on management of patient’s pain and discomfort in conjunction with sedation.
3.1.4.  Administer Fentanyl and/or Midazolam per physician orders. If no orders obtained, use

guidelines below.

3.1.5.  If the transferring physician discontinues Propofol to allow for a CCP level transport and,
initiates other sedation, consider trialing the new infusion at facility to check effectiveness
prior to transport.

4. ADMINISTRATION

4.1. Fentanyl

4.1.1.  Fentanyl Bolus Guidelines:

• Administer Fentanyl boluses in accordance with local EMS agency policy OR guidelines

below:
o Adult:

• Standard dose: 50 mcg IV/IO/IN/IM q 5 mins.
• Weight-based dose: 1 mcg/kg IV/IO/IN/IM with single dose max 100 mcg q 5 mins.

o Pediatric:

• Standard dose: 50 mcg IV/IO/IN/IM for patients weighing 50 kg or more.
• Weight-based dose: 1-2 mcg/kg IV/IO/IN/IM to a max dose of 100 mcg q 5 mins.
• Standard or weight-based dose may be repeated q 5 mins at initial dose or at ½ dose if
concern for hypotension. May not switch between standard and weight-based dosing.

24

SEDATION AND ANALGESIA

• For patients weighing less than 25 kg, dilute by taking 2 ml Fentanyl (100 mcg) and 8 ml

NS to equal a concentration of 10 mcg/ml.

4.1.2  Fentanyl Infusion Guidelines:

• Typical dosing range is 25-200 mcg/hr.
• May titrate by 25 mcg/hr q 5 mins as needed.

4.2  Midazolam

4.2.1  Midazolam Bolus Guidelines:

• Administer Midazolam  boluses in accordance with local EMS agency policy OR guidelines

below:
o Adult:

• Standard Dose: 2 mg IV/IO/IN for patients weighing 40 kg or more q 5 mins.
• Weight-Based Dose: 0.05 mg/kg IV/IO/IN with a max single dose of 5 mg q 5 mins.
•
IM Dose: 0.1 mg/kg IM with a single max dose if 10 mg. May repeat once in 5 mins.

o Pediatric: (Not to be used in neonates)

• Standard Dose: 2 mg IV/IO/IN for patients weighing 40 kg or more q 5 mins.
• Weight-Based Dose: 0.05 mg/kg slow IV push q 5 mins with max single dose of 5

mg

• Standard or weight-based dose may be repeated q 5 mins at initial dose or at ½ dose if
concern for hypotension. May not switch between standard and weight-based dosing.
• For patients weighing less than 25 kg, dilute IV/IO/IM doses to 1 mg Versed in 1 ml NS. Do

not dilute IN doses.

4.2.2  Midazolam Infusion Guidelines:
• Typical dosing is 2-10 mg/hr.
• May titrate by 2 mg/hr q 5 mins to a maximum of 10 mg/hr.
• Patients requiring rapidly escalating doses of Midazolam should be considered for

concurrent Fentanyl administration.

4.3  Morphine

4.3.1

 Morphine Bolus Guidelines:

• Morphine boluses may be administered as a second line narcotic in situations where

Fentanyl is contraindicated, has been ineffective, or Morphine is preferred by transferring,
receiving, or base hospital physician AND the CCP unit stocks.

• Administer Morphine boluses in accordance with local EMS policy OR guidelines below:

o Adult:

 Standard Dose:



4 mg IV/IO/IM unless AMI or ACS patient.
1 mg IV/IO/IM for AMI or ACS patient. If no relief with morphine strongly consider
an alternative analgesia.

 May repeat IV/IO q 5 mins and IM q 10 mins at the initial dose or half dose.
 Weight-Based Dose: 0.1 mg/kg IV/IO/IM q 5 mins for IV/IO and q 10 mins for IM

with max single dose of 10 mg.

25

SEDATION AND ANALGESIA

o Pediatric:

0.1 mg/kg IV/IO/IM q 5 mins.


 For patients weighing less than 25 kg, dilute IV/IO/IM doses to 1 mg Morphine in 1

ml NS.

4.3.2  Morphine Infusion Guidelines:

• The infusion concentration and regulation of the infusion rate will occur within the

parameters as defined by the transferring physician but may be titrated to the patient
response during transport per transferring or base hospital physician orders only.
