DOPAMINE (Intropin)
FOR USE ONLY WHEN EPINEPHRINE ON SHORTAGE

ACTION: Sympathomimetic
•  Catecholamine with dose-dependent stimulation of alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and

dopaminergic receptors.
o  Low doses (2 to 5 mcg/kg/min): Stimulates dopaminergic receptors (renal and mesenteric artery

dilation).

o  Medium doses (5 to 10 mcg/kg/min): Stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors (increased heart rate

and contractility resulting in increased cardiac output).

o  High doses (greater than 10 mcg/kg/min): Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors (peripheral

vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure).

INDICATION
1. Hypotension due to
cardiogenic shock or
distributive shock (neurogenic,
septic, or anaphylactic subtype)
2. Symptomatic bradycardia
refractory to other treatments
such as atropine and pacing

ADULT
Start 5 mcg/kg/min IV/IO.
May titrate up to 20
mcg/kg/min to target SBP >
90 mmHg. If taking MAOIs
in the last 2 weeks, use
1/10th of the normal dose.

PEDIATRIC
MAKE BASE HOSPITAL
CONTACT BEFORE
INITIATING. Start 5
mcg/kg/min IV/IO. May
titrate up to 20
mcg/kg/min. If taking
MAOIs in the last 2 weeks,
use 1/10th of the normal
dose.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
•  Tachydysrhythmias

POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
•  Tachydysrhythmias including V-Tach and V-

Fib

•  Hypertension
•  Nausea and vomiting

•  Chest pain, ischemia, and acute MI

exacerbation

•  Extravasation causes tissue necrosis

NOTES:
•  Do not infuse in same line as sodium bicarbonate
•  Ensure that the patient is not hypovolemic before infusing dopamine.
•  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) potentiate the effects of dopamine. MAOIs include selegiline

(Emsam), tranylcypromine (Parnate), and phenelzine (Nardil).
