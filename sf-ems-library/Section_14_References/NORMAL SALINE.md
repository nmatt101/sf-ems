ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
 IV/IO of Normal Saline TKO.
 If SBP < 90 or signs of poor perfusion, fluid bolus 500 mL if lungs are clear. Reassess and repeat if

indicated.

 Burns: If partial thickness or total thickness burns > 10% BSA, fluid bolus 500 mL if lungs are clear.

Reassess and repeat if indicated.

 Crush Syndrome: Bolus of 2 L followed by 500 mL/hr.
 Cardiac Arrest in Pregnancy: If SBP < 90 or signs of poor perfusion, fluid bolus 500 ml. Reassess and

repeat if indicated.

 Post Cardiac Arrest or Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC): If SBP < 90 or signs of poor

perfusion, fluid bolus 1000 mL if lungs are clear. Reassess and repeat if indicated.

 Suspected Sepsis: For signs of hypoperfusion and HR > 100 or BP < 90, fluid bolus 1000 mL if lungs

are clear. Reassess and repeat if indicated.

PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
 IV/IO of Normal Saline TKO.
 Use buretrol or similar device to prevent volume overload pediatric patients with fluid
 Pediatric hypovolemic shock: IV/IO bolus of 20 mL/Kg. Repeat up to 60 mL/Kg if indicated.
 Neonatal hypovolemic shock: 10 mL/Kg. Repeat up to 30 mL/Kg.
 AMS of Unknown Cause: IV/IO bolus of 10 mL/Kg.

NOTES:
• Use cautiously in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical
states in which there exists edema with sodium retention (e.g., patients with diminished renal
function.)
Discontinue bolus if pulmonary edema develops.
