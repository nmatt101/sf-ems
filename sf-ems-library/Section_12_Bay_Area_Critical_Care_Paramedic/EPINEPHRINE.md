1. PURPOSE

EPINEPHRINE

To authorize CCP’s to initiate, monitor, and adjust existing intravenous Epinephrine infusions

2. POLICY

2.1. CCP’s are permitted to initiate, monitor, and adjust Epinephrine infusions.
2.2. CCP’s are permitted to administer push dose Epinephrine.

3. PRECAUTIONS

3.1. Use caution in patients who may be volume depleted.
3.2. Use caution in patients who are on multiple vasopressors.

4. PROCEDURE

4.1. Epinephrine Infusion Parameters

4.1.1.  Regulation of the infusion rate will occur within the parameters as defined by the

transferring or base hospital physician or by standing orders.

4.1.2.  CCP’s may titrate Epinephrine to achieve a MAP > 65 mmHg q 5 mins increments.
4.1.3.  Typical initial Epinephrine dose range is 0.03 mcg/kg/min to 1 mcg/kg/min.
4.1.4.  The maximum Epinephrine dose is 1 mcg/kg/min.
4.1.5.  Adult Infusion: Mix by adding 10 mg Epi 1:1,000 (10 ml) to 90 ml NS, D5W, or D10W.

This will provide a total volume of 100 ml and a concentration of 100 mcg/ml.
• For patient’s in excess of 100 kg, consideration for the length of transport should be
made to determine the amount of infusion necessary to complete the transport.

o Example - 40 kg patient at a rate of 1 mcg/kg/min and the 100 ml infusion will

last ~ 80 mins

4.1.6.  Pediatric Infusion: Mix by adding 2 mg Epinephrine 1:1,000 (2 ml) to 98 ml of NS, D5W.

This will provide a total volume of 100 ml and a concentration of 20 mcg/ml.
4.1.7.  In cases of severe hypertension, the infusion will be titrated down and, if necessary,

discontinue, and notify the transferring physician or base hospital.

5. ADMINISTRATION

5.1. Epinephrine infusion initiation should be considered for hypotensive shock states after ensuring

adequate patient ventilation, oxygenation, and volume repletion.

5.2. Initiate Epinephrine at 0.03 mcg/kg/min and titrate to achieve a MAP > 65 mmHg.
5.3. Infusion alternate is to administer push dose Epi per EMS ALS treatment guidelines OR as

follows:
5.3.1.  Must ensure patient preload has been optimized with crystalloid and/or colloid prior to

utilization of push dose Epi

5.3.2.  Dilute Epinephrine by mixing 1 ml Epi 1:10,000 in 9 ml NS to equal a concentration of 10
mcg/ml. This will yield 10 doses in a 10 ml syringe as each dose is 10 mcg or 1 ml

5.3.3.  Adult Dose: 10 mcg (1 ml) q 5 min
5.3.4.  Peds Dose: 1 mcg/kg q 5 mins with a max single dose of 50 mcg
