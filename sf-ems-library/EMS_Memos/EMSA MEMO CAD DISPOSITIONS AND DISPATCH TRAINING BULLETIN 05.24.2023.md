Subject:  Dispositions in CAD

The San Francisco Division of Emergency Communications is taking steps to simplify Computer Aided
Dispatch (CAD) dispositions for EMS. These changes were vetted by the medical directors of all 9-1-1
ambulance providers.

A few key changes are included in this memorandum. The full dispatch Training Bulletin is available for
reference on the “EMS Memo” section of the San Francisco EMS Policies and Protocols site.

There have been no changes to EMS Agency documentation requirements.

NON – Non-Transport

The “NON” disposition will be used for any medical call that does not result in an ambulance transport.
This encompasses AMAs, PDTs and any incident previously declared a “walk-away”, “no merit” or
“sleeper”. Contact with persons identified as a patient should be documented according to existing
procedures (see EMS Agency Policy 4040).

“NON” will also be utilized for non-ambulance transports by the Community Paramedicine team.

Two Cancellation Dispositions

CPD – Cancelled by PD

The “CPD” disposition will be used by dispatchers when a cancellation comes from law enforcement and
Fire/EMS crews have not made patient contact.

CAN – Cancel

“CAN” will be used for all other cancellations with no patient contact.

Suppression Incidents

FIR – NFIRS Report
No changes
Use  disposition  “FIR”  for  suppression  incidents,  including  false  alarms,  fires,  and  non-
medical  service/assist  calls.  It  is  not  necessary  to  document  false  alarms  with  an
alternate  disposition.  The  SFFD  officer  who  responded  to  the  scene  documents  all
suppression calls in NFIRS, including very specific information on false alarms.

Training Bulletin

5.19.2023

If a call has a combination of suppression and medical service, such as a working fire
with  smoke  inhalation  victims,  the  disposition  must  first  reflect  the  disposition  of
any involved patients.

New Dispositions

NON - Non-Transport or Non-Ambulance Transport

Use One: Non-Transport (AMA, PDT, NOM, “sleeper”, “walk-away”, “put back to bed”)

Use  “NON”  as  the  disposition  for  any  medical  call  that  does  not  result  in  ambulance
transport.  This  encompasses  AMAs  (Against  Medical  Advice)  and  PDTs  (Patient
Declined  Transport).  It  also  includes  any  incidents  previously  declared  a  “walk-away”,
“no  merit”,  “sleeper”,  or  “assist  only”  (on  medical  call).  This  includes  if  an  engine
arrives on scene, makes patient contact, and cancels the ambulance. In all cases,
a  patient  was  identified  (see  definition  of  “patient”  in  EMSA  Policy  4040)  and
documentation is required.

The  dispatcher  should  continue  to  document  pertinent  comments  in  CAD  (e.g.
“delayed on scene AMA”) per standing practice.

The difference between a PDT and AMA is important, but this data is better captured in
the Patient Care Record (PCR) rather than CAD.

Use  Two:  Transport  to  an  Alternative  Destination  by  CP  (clinic,  shelter,  detox,
navigation center).

Use  “NON”  when  a  Community  Paramedicine  unit  transports  a  patient  to  an Alternate
Destination  (e.g.,  clinic,  shelter,  detox,  navigation  center).   The  “NON”  disposition
indicates that a patient was not transported by ambulance.

EVT – Event Transport (for use by a DEC Special Event Dispatcher)

Most  Special Event  runs  don’t  have a disposition  because  they are  appended  into the
ADM incident (2R01) for the Special Event by Hot Seat.

EVT is reserved for use during “Special Events” that have a dedicated DEC dispatcher
(who may be off-site at a Command Post). In this circumstance, event medical units are

dispatched  using  –  and  have  their  status  tracked  in  –  CAD.  This  typically  happens
during civic events such as the Warriors Parade or New Year’s Eve celebrations.

The EVT disposition indicates transport by a special event unit (Gator, FAST Team) to
an  established  treatment  area  (e.g.,  aid  station,  medical  tent,  temporary  sobering
clinic, SFFD MCT bus). This is not a blanket disposition for all incidents within the event
box. If a patient is transported to the hospital, or PDT/AMA’d on scene, UTL, then EVT
is not appropriate.

Do  not  use  the  EVT  disposition  for  events  without  a  DEC  dispatcher.  When  a  run  is
referred  to  a  designated  event  medical  contact  who  confirms  that  on-site  staff  are
handling (for example, an intoxicated patient at a Giants Game, or a “trip and fall” at a
Recreation and Park Festival), a CAD disposition is not needed. Document the details
of  communication  between  DEC  and  Event  Medical  in  the  run,  then  use  the  “DUP”
command to append the run to the event’s ADM incident.

PRI – Private Transport or Assist (Non-911)

Use “PRI” when a private ambulance company requests assistance with a private call,
such as the “APA” (Assist Private Ambulance) incident type. This includes requests for
a lift assist and times when a “first response” unit is requested on a private “code three”
dispatch.

“PRI” may also be used if a facility called both private ambulance dispatch AND 911. If
both centers send a unit (unaware of the other's response) and later determine that the
privately dispatched unit will handle, set the disposition to “PRI”.

Do not use this disposition when a “private” ambulance is posted on the 911 board and
dispatched by DEC for a 911-system call.

Cancellations – “CPD” vs. “CAN”

Use “CPD” when cancellation came from law enforcement (SFPD, CHP, US Park, etc.)
and Fire/EMS crews made no patient contact. If patient contact has been made, another
disposition is more appropriate (e.g., NON if no patient transported).

"CAN”  will  be  used  for  any  other  cancellations,  (for  example,  patient  with  no  priority
symptoms  advises  call  taker  they  wish  to  cancel;  medical  advisement  read  and
acknowledged).

Note: If the Engine/QRV gets onscene and cancels the medic, then that is a NON.

Existing Dispositions – No Changes or Clarification Required

UTL – Unable to Locate
‘GOA’ will be removed from the system as a Fire CAD disposition. The disposition
for any incident reported “Gone on Arrival” or “Unable to Locate” will be UTL.

Training Bulletin

5.19.2023

OME – Office of the Medical Examiner
Death declared on scene.

DUP – Duplicate Incident
Duplicate  incidents  typically  have  no  disposition  at  all.  The  standard  method  of
documenting  a  duplicate  incident  is  to  append  (or  “DUP”)  into  the  existing  call.  This
disposition  remains  in  CAD  if  needed  for  infrequent  exceptions  that  require  supervisor
approval. If used, CAD records should be cross-referenced using the XREF command.

Example:  Medic  84  responds  to  the  street  corner  for  a  fall  and  transports  an  elderly
patient to the hospital. Five hours later, the patient’s son checks his voicemail and calls
9-1-1 in a panic saying that his mother fell and is not answering her phone. Crews are
dispatched  to  the  patient’s  home  but  are  unable  to  locate  her.  Dispatchers  piece
together  that  the  patient  was  transported  five  hours  ago  and  is  still  in  the  Emergency
Department.

It is not appropriate to re-open the original call. Cross-reference the incidents (using the
“XREF”  command)  and  consult  a  supervisor  before  closing  the  second  call  with  the
“DUP” disposition.

(Dormant) ECN – Handled by Emergency Communications Nurse
The Emergency Communications Nurse System is not currently active in our PSAP. If it
returns, this disposition will be utilized for calls handled and closed by the ECN.

(Dormant) RFR – “Assess & Refer”
“Assess and Refer” is only to be utilized when permitted by a temporary order issued by
the  EMS  Agency’s  medical  director.  Thus  far,  “RFR”  has  only  been  authorized  once,
during the January 2022 Omicron surge. If an order is issued, paramedics may advise
low-risk  patients  that  their  current  condition does  not  require  ambulance  transport  and
refer them to alternate options.

Hierarchy of Disposition Choices (Multiple Patients)

When multiple patients are identified on a single incident, the CAD record should reflect
each patient’s outcome or transport code. Set the incident disposition according to the
hierarchy below but ensure that comments accurately account for each patient.

MCI – Multi-Casualty or Mass-Casualty Incident
Utilize if six or more patients are identified, regardless of the number of transports.

Example:  passenger  van  overturned  on  highway  101;  Division  3  declares  MCI;  seven
patients identified.

4 | Page

Training Bulletin

5.19.2023

CAD Documentation should include:

o  the number of patients
o  their triage level (red, yellow, green, or black/zebra)
o  transport code of each ambulance

TMP - Transport Multiple Patients
Utilize  when  multiple  patients  are  transported,  but  the  incident  does  not  meet  MCI
criteria (five or fewer patients identified).

Example: two assault victims are assessed, and both are transported.
Document the number of patients and the transport code of each ambulance.

TH2 – Transport to Hospital “Code Two”
TH3 – Transport to Hospital “Code Three”

Utilize  when  one  or  more  patients  assessed,  but  only  one  patient  is  transported  by
ambulance (no MCI declared).

Example:  two  assault  victims  assessed,  resulting  in  one  patient  declining  transport
against  medical  advice  and  one  “code  two”  transport.  Document  the  “AMA”  in  call
comments and set the disposition of the incident to TH2.

Separate CAD Required – if an unrelated patient is found on scene, open a separate
incident to document their care, making relevant notes in each CAD record.

Example:  An  engine medic  is  evaluating a patient  with  a  chief  complaint  of  chest  pain
when they are approached by a second patient reporting ankle pain after a fall.  These
are unrelated medical incidents. Create a second CAD for the second patient.

Note that once removed, it will not be possible to use a defunct disposition as a search
term to query CAD records. Use other criteria to locate these calls (e.g., location, date,
etc.)

If a user needs to query “all EMS incidents with disposition SCT”, utilize data warehouse
queries, as CCAD itself will no longer recognize the disposition.
