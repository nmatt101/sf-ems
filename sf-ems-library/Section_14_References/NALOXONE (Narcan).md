NALOXONE (Narcan)

ACTION:  Narcotic Antagonist
•  Antagonizes effects of opiate narcotic agents by competing at the receptor site resulting in

reversal of respiratory depression associated with opiate overdoses.

INDICATIONS:
•  Altered Mental Status in the presence of suspected narcotic overdose, or coma of unknown

etiology.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
•  Patients with hypersensitivity to the drug.
•  Neonate in the setting of opiate dependence.

POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
•  Rapid administration can cause

projectile vomiting.

•  May precipitate withdrawal in chronic

narcotic users.

•  Patients may become agitated or
violent after drug is administered.

ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
  IVP/IM/IO: 0.4 mg, may repeat in 5 min for continued respiratory depression up to 2mg.
  Intranasal: 2 mg via mucosal atomizer device (MAD), may repeat in 5 min for continued

respiratory depression.

PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  DO NOT GIVE to NEONATES
  Less than 20 kg: 0.1 mg/kg IV/IM/IO.
  Greater than 20 kg: 2 mg IN via MAD or IVP/ IM/ IO.

NOTES:
•  Doses of Naloxone smaller than 2 mg may be given if it is suspected that the patient may

have taken a combination of heroin and cocaine (“speedball”).

•  Because Naloxone is a short-acting narcotic antagonist, repeat doses may have to be given

if the patient’s LOC and respiratory status start to diminish again.

•  Higher doses of Naloxone may be indicated for some opiate overdoses (Buprenorphine,

Suboxone, and Darvocet).
