8.08 PEDIATRIC POISONING AND OVERDOSE

BLS Treatment – ALL Pediatric Poisoning and Overdoses

•  Assess vital signs
•  Assess circulation, airway, breathing, and responsiveness
•  NPO
•  Oxygen as indicated.

ALS Treatment - ALL Pediatric Poisoning and Overdoses
Current American Heart Association Guidelines concerning Emergency Cardiac Care
assessments and interventions shall always take precedence over local protocols when there
is a conflict concerning techniques of resuscitation.

•  Advanced airway as indicated.
•  Assess for substance type.
•  Check blood glucose. If blood glucose <60 mg/dl: Dextrose.
•
•  Dextrose

If no IV or IO access: administer Glucagon.

•  Neonates < 1 month: D10W 2ml/kg IV/IO (0.2g/kg)
•  Children > 1 month: D10W 5ml/kg (0.5g/kg/ max 25 gram)

•  Glucagon

•

•  Less than 20kg: 0.5mg IM/IV
•  Greater than 20kg: 1mg IM/IV
IV/IO of Normal Saline TKO.
•  Pediatric hypovolemic shock: IV/IO bolus of 20ml/kg. Repeat up to 60ml/kg if indicated.
•  Neonatal hypovolemic shock: 10 ml/kg. Repeat up to 30ml/kg.

•  May consult California Poison Control (800) 222-1222.

Base Hospital Contact Criteria

•

If Poison Control recommends treatment outside of current protocols.

NEVER induce vomiting.

ALS Treatment – SPECIFIC Pediatric Poisoning and Overdoses
UNKNOWN SUBSTANCE

•  Naloxone:

o  Less than 20kg: 0.1mg/kg IV/IM/IO
o  Greater than 20kg: 2mg IN via MAD or IVP/IM/IO
o  Neonate = AVOID use in neonate

•  Activated Charcoal mixed in water to form a slurry IF patient is alert; able to maintain

8.08 PEDIATRIC POISONING AND OVERDOSE

KNOWN OR SUSPECTED OPIATES

Pinpoint pupils, respiratory depression, decreased level of consciousness, hypotension and
decreased muscle tone:
•  Naloxone:

o  Less than 20kg: 0.1mg/kg IV/IM/IO/IN
o  Greater than 20kg: 2mg IN via MAD or IVP/IM/IO
o  Neonate = AVOID use in neonate

ANTIPSYCHOTICS WITH EXTRAPYRAMIDAL EFFECTS
(Haldol, Haloperidol)

Fixed, deviated gaze to one side of body, painful spasm of trunk or extremity muscles and
difficulty speaking:
•  Diphenhydramine

o  1mg/kg IVP/IO/IM (up to 25mg max)

ORGANOPHOSPHATES

SLUDGE Symptoms:  Salivation, lacrimation, urination, diaphoresis/diarrhea, gastric
hypermotility, and emesis/eye (small pupils, blurry vision):
•  Atropine

o  0.02mg/kg IV/IO (min dose 0.1mg, no max dose)

Organophosphate: Consult Protocol 11.03 Special Circumstances: Chemical and Radiologic
Agents for further treatment.

TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS
May experience rapid depression of mental status, sudden seizures, or worsening of vital signs:
•
•  Sodium Bicarbonate

If hypotensive, seizing and / or wide QRS > 0.10 sec

•  1mEq/kg IV/IO, (max of 50mEq per dose). Repeat q5 min until ECG changes improve
(QRS<100) and/or to a total of 150 mEq. If <2 years, dilute 1:1 with sterile water.

BETA BLOCKER OR CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER
(e.g. Metoprolol)

Bradycardia, hypotension and / or shock:
•  Activated Charcoal mixed in water to form a slurry IF patient is alert; able to maintain

airway; non-acid, non-caustic, non-petroleum ingestion; it is within 1-hour of ingestion AND
>1 year old.

Base Hospital Contact Criteria

Contact Base Physician for approval of:
•  Glucagon for Beta Blockers.
•  Calcium Chloride 10% solution for Calcium Channel Blockers.

o  20 mg/kg IV/IO over 5 min

Comments
Ensure that you have patent IV line as Calcium Chloride extravasation will cause tissue necrosis

CARBON MONOXIDE (CO)  / HYDROGEN SULFIDE

Consider CO poisoning if found unconscious, or has AMS, or non-specific complaints AND
patient situation includes:

•  Found down in enclosed space with CO source (running motors, indoor use of

charcoal/ gas grill/ generator or heater malfunction)

•  Multiple persons sharing the vicinity have similar symptoms.
•  Environmental CO detectors are alarming.

Give 100% NRB or via BVM regardless of pulse oximeter reading.

Patients with CO and hydrogen sulfide may have normal oxygen saturation readings, but
cellular hypoxia due to displacement of the oxygen molecule from the hemoglobin in red
blood cells.
