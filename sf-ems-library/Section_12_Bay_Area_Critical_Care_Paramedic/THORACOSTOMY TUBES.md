THORACOSTOMY TUBES

1. PURPOSE

To authorize CCP’s to monitor existing surgically placed thoracostomy tubes

2. POLICY

2.1. CCP’s are permitted to monitor thoracostomy tubes during interfacility transports.
2.2. CCP’s may not perform placement of thoracostomy tubes.

3. PRECAUTIONS

3.1. Avoid pulling on the thoracostomy tube to prevent accidental dislodging of the tube.
3.2. Do not permit dependent loops or kinks to form in the tubing, as this will interfere with the flow

of drainage leading to increased pleural pressure or formation of clots.

3.3. Do not disconnect the drainage system or puncture the tubing. Tape all connections securely

to prevent violation of sterility and loss of negative pressure.

4. PROCEDURE

4.1. The collection receptacle must be kept below the level of the chest to prevent drained fluid
from re-entering the pleural space. Do not allow the collection receptacle to tip over.

4.2. If hemorrhage occurs through the chest tube, observe for signs and symptoms of shock and

treat according to local EMS agency protocols.

4.3. Mechanical suction rates must remain constant during the transport with no regulation of the

rate being performed by the CCP.

4.4. Patients shall be placed and maintained on cardiac and pulse oximetry monitors during

transport.

4.5. Signed order guidelines from the transferring physician must be obtained prior to transport.
4.6. Transfer order guidelines must provide for specifying the maintenance of the chest tube either

to gravity or mechanical suction drainage. The amount of mechanical suction must be
specified.

5. COMPLICATIONS

5.1. If the thoracostomy tube is partially pulled out:
• Do not push the tube back in the chest
• Secure the site

5.2. If the thoracostomy tube is completely pulled out:

• Place an occlusive dressing over the insertion site.

5.3. If air leaks are present:

•

 check all connections
5.4. If the patient becomes dyspneic:

• Assess breath sounds
• Contact the base hospital (needle thoracostomy may need to be performed)
