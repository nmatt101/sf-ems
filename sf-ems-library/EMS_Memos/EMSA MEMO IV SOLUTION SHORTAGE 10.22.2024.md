Subject:  IV Solution Shortage due to Hurricane Helene

As a result of Hurricane Helene, facility and site operations at the Baxter International plant (a major
manufacturer of IV and peritoneal dialysis solutions) in North Carolina have been disrupted. While there
are several IV solution suppliers, the San Francisco EMS Agency anticipates significant impacts in
availability and has been working closely with the MHOAC and Region II Disaster Medical Health system
to identify supplies and conduct polling of available resources. The shortage is expected to last at least
through the end of the year, and the EMS Agency will notify partners of any updates.

Due to anticipated supply chain and procurement issues, EMS Providers should:
-  Message conservation to Paramedics (including Critical Care)
-  Assess supply versus burn rate (e.g. number of days left) and limit access to inventory
-  Consider procurement from multiple manufactures or vendors
-  Notify the EMS Agency and MHOAC of critical supply shortages

Paramedics should:
-  Administer IV solutions to emergent patients, where clinically indicated in the prehospital setting,
and would be otherwise detrimental to the patient prior to arrival at a hospital, for example:

o  Patients needing immediate fluid resuscitation (e.g. heat stroke victim)
o  Patients needing medications via IV infusion (e.g. epinephrine drip post-resuscitation)

-  Administer medications using a non-IV route (or through an IV saline lock) if can be done so safely
and the protocol indicates multiple administration route options (e.g. administer ondansetron ODT
or IM, not via IV)

-  Not pre-emptively start IVs where not clinically indicated or to use an IV saline lock

The EMS Agency and MHOAC system appreciate your support. Through conservation of IV solution
products, EMS Providers and Paramedics are prioritizing future needs for critical patients and emergent
administration of IV solutions. For any questions, please contact the EMS Agency.
