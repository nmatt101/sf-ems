BUPRENORPHINE AND NALOXONE (Suboxone)

ACTION:  Partial Opioid Agonist
•  Buprenorphine: Binds opioid receptors with high affinity but moderate efficacy (partial agonist). This
partial agonism makes buprenorphine suitable for treating withdrawal symptoms while improving
its safety profile compared to other opioids.

•  Naloxone: Antagonizes effects of opioids by competing at the receptor site, resulting in reversal of
respiratory depression associated with opiate overdoses. When taken sublingually Naloxone is inert
and has no effect on the patient.

INDICATION
Opiate withdrawal with COWS
score ≥8

ADULT
16 mg SL

PEDIATRIC
Not applicable under age 16

May repeat 8 mg x1 in 10
min.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
•  Hypersensitivity or prior allergic reaction
•  Patient meets exclusion criteria described in protocol 2.18 Opiate Withdrawal Appendix B
•  COWS score < 8

POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
•  Precipitated opioid withdrawal (less likely to occur if

patient is already withdrawing with a COWS score ≥ 8)

•  Diaphoresis

•  Headache
•  Nausea
•  Constipation
•  Tooth decay

NOTES:
•  Naloxone is poorly absorbed through the GI tract. When formulated with buprenorphine, naloxone
reduces the risk of overdose in those who misuse the combination medication by injection, while
also reducing its abuse potential.

•  When buprenorphine is formulated alone, common brand names include Belbuca, Buprenex,

Butrans, Sublocade, and Subutex, whereas Suboxone is a brand name of a formulation containing
buprenorphine and naloxone.
