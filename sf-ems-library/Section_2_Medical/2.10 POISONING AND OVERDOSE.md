2.10 POISONING AND OVERDOSE

BLS Treatment – General Guidelines

Position of comfort.

•
• NPO except as noted below.
• Oxygen as indicated.

ALS Treatment – General Guidelines

•
•

Establish IV/IO, Normal Saline at TKO.
For nausea / vomiting, may administer Ondansetron.

BLS and ALS Treatment for Specific Poisoning and Overdose Incidents
Follow Treatment Guidance Based on Provider Level
NARCOTICS/OPIATE OVERDOSE
(e.g. Heroin, Demerol, Methadone, Morphine, Fentanyl, Dolophine, Darvocet, Darvon,
Propoxyphene, Oxycodone, Oxycontin, Oxyir, Percocet)

Assess for symmetrical, pinpoint pupils, respiratory depression/apnea, decreased level of
consciousness, bradycardia, hypotension and decreased muscle tone:
•

For suspected overdose with respiratory depression not responsive to BLS airway
interventions:  Naloxone

• Consider EMS-Distributed Leave Behind Naloxone under Policy 2.03 Altered

Mental Status

• After administering Naloxone, assess for possible opiate withdrawal.

• Administer high-flow Oxygen via NRB. Assist ventilations with BVM as needed.
• Do NOT withhold Oxygen therapy for patients with respiratory compromise and “normal”

CARBON MONOXIDE

pulse oximeter values.

CALCIUM CHANNEL or BETA BLOCKER TOXICITY
(e.g. Verapamil, Metoprolol)

Assess for bradycardia, hypotension and shock; apply and assess 12-lead EKG:
• Activated Charcoal
• Calcium Chloride as indicated for Calcium Channel Blocker overdose.
• Glucagon as indicated for Beta Blocker Toxicity.

2.10 POISONING AND OVERDOSE

TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS
(e.g. Elavil, Amitriptyline, Etrafon, Pamelor, Nortriptyline)

• Oxygen as indicated.
•

If SBP <90, seizure, and/or QRS widening > 0.10 seconds is present: Sodium Bicarbonate

ANTIPSYCHOTICS WITH EXTRAPYRAMIDAL REACTION
(e.g. Haldol, Haloperidol)
Assess for fixed, deviated gaze to one side of body, painful spasm of trunk or extremity muscles
and/or difficulty speaking:
• Diphenhydramine

CYANIDE
Assess for nausea, headache, anxiety, agitation, weakness, muscular trembling, seizures, apnea,
soot around mouth or airway:
• Remove contaminated clothing. Do NOT transport with patient.
• Give Hydroxocobalamin for suspected overdose and if available.
• Hydroxocobalamin is not routinely stocked on the ambulances but is available in your

provider disaster caches. Transport patient to receiving hospital for treatment if there is any
delay in ability to administer Hydroxocobalamin.

ORGANOPHOSPHATES
(e.g. Malathion)

Assess for “SLUDGE”:  (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Diaphoresis/Diarrhea, Gastric
hypermotility, Emesis/Eye (small pupils, blurry vision). Severe exposures may result in
decreased level of consciousness, fasciculation/muscle weakness, paralysis, seizures:
• Administer Atropine until SLUDGE symptoms subside.
•

Treat seizures with Midazolam.

NERVE AGENTS

(e.g. VX, Sarin, Soman, Tabun)

Same as signs/symptoms as Organophosphate Poisoning (see above).
• Administer Atropine until SLUDGE symptoms subside.
•

If available, administer DuoDote [Atropine/Pralidoxime (2-PAM)] Autoinjector IM in
using dosing table below:

DuoDote (2-PAM)  Dosing Estimator
DuoDote = Atropine 2.1mg / Pralidoxime 600mg

Do NOT Use
Atropine/2-PAM
Injector

• No signs of life
•
Fits non-
resuscitation
group (expectant)
due to other
concomitant injury

Use Between  1 – 3
Atropine/2-PAM Injectors IM

Elderly

Titrate dose based on 1 or more
SLUDGE signs and:
•
• Children appearing under age 14
•
Prolonged extrication (may
require more than 3
autoinjectors)

Use 3
Atropine/2-PAM Injectors
IM
Exhibiting 2 or more
SLUDGE signs OR
• Non-ambulatory

•

Bronchospasm and respiratory secretions are the best acute symptoms to monitor response
to Atropine/2-PAM therapy:
• Decreased bronchospasm and respiratory secretions = getting better.
• No change or increased bronchospasm and respiratory secretions = Base Hospital Contact

for administration of additional medication, in excess of listed Maximum Dosage.

• May contact Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222 if substance is unknown.

Comments

Base Hospital Contact Criteria

• Contact Base Physician if Poison Control recommends treatment outside of current

protocols.
Suspected Narcotic overdose not responsive to max doses of Naloxone.

•
• Bradycardia and/or hypotension caused by a CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKER: Calcium

Chloride.

• Bradycardia and/or hypotension caused by a BETA BLOCKER:  Glucagon.
