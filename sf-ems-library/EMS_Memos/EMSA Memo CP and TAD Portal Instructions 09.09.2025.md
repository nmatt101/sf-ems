Subject: Triage to Alt. Dest. (TAD) and Community Paramedicine (CP) Renewal Application Instructions

As the majority of CP and TAD accredited paramedics are up for renewal starting October 2025, please
see the attached instructions for access to the new EMS Agency platform. CP and TAD applications must
be submitted through the portal. As a reminder, SFEMSA requires all Paramedics working on an
ambulance to maintain active TAD accreditation. If you are unsure of your expiration date, please visit
here.

Step 1 (TAD-only): Complete the 4-hour 2025 TAD training by visiting here. Your completion certificate
will automatically be uploaded to your profile by EMS Agency staff.

Step 2: Visit the EMS Agency certifications portal by visiting:
https://sanfrancisco.imagetrendlicense.com/lms/public/portal#/login

Step 3: All current CP and TAD accredited paramedics have an existing account as part of the transition
to a paperless platform. Click on “Forgot Username” and follow the prompts to claim your account. You
will be prompted to provide an email. Please use your work email if you are issued one. Your last name
must match exactly with the name on file with the EMS Agency to claim your account (check your most
recent accreditation card). If you are unable to access your account, please email
emsacertifications@sfgov.org.

Step 4: You will receive an email with your username with a link to reset your password. Check your
spam folder if you do not receive the email.

Step 5: Log-in and navigate to the menu on left-hand side of page. Select “Applications”

Step 6: Select “View All Personnel Applications”

Step 7: Select the CP and/or TAD application by clicking “Apply Now” button. If you are both CP and TAD
accredited, you will need to complete both applications.

Step 9: Monitor your email closely. Once you submit an application, you will receive a confirmation
email. Once your application is approved, you will receive an email with your CP or TAD e-card as an
attachment. Physical cards are no longer issued for CP and TAD accreditations.

Only CP and TAD accreditation applications are currently accepted through the portal. Continue to
follow the standard process for ALS Local and EMT certifications as those application types will be
transitioning in late 2025. More information can be found by visiting sf.gov/emsa.

EMS Agency staff are available and will support EMS personnel with renewal applications, accessing the
new TAD training, or any additional questions/concerns. The best way to contact the EMS Agency is by
emailing emsacertifications@sfgov.org or by calling 628-217-6000.
