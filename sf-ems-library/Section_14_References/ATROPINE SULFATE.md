ATROPINE SULFATE

ACTION:  Anticholinergic (Vagolytic)
•  Blocks acetylcholine receptors resulting in reduction of parasympathathetic tone and

•

increased conduction through the AV node.
Increases sinus node automaticity and AV conduction when suppressed by abnormal
parasympathetic or vagal discharges.

•  Antagonizes action of organophosphate agents.

INDICATIONS:
•  Symptomatic bradycardia.
•  Organophosphate or carbamate insecticide or nerve agent exposure.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
•  Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter
•  Glaucoma

Increased Heart Rate causing tachycardias

POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
•
•  Post-atropine tachycardias can precipitate V-FIB or V-TACH
•  Can worsen patient’s ischemia or extend the size of infarct
•  Dry mouth/decreased salivation
•  Doses lower than 0.5mg can produce slowing of the heart
•  Dilated pupils
•  Flushed, hot skin

ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
  Symptomatic Bradycardia:   1mg IVP or IO. May repeat every 5 min up to 3 mg if no

resolution of bradycardia.

  Organophosphate Poisoning/Nerve agent Exposure:  2 – 5mg IVP or IO. May repeat in 5

minutes until symptoms improve (i.e. bronchorrhea resolves). No max dose.

PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  Symptomatic Bradycardia:  0.02 mg/kg IVP or IO (min dose 0.1mg, max single dose 0.5mg)
  Organophosphate Poisoning:  0.02 mg/kg IVP or IO (min dose 0.1mg, no max dose). May

repeat every 5 minutes until symptoms improve (i.e. bronchorrhea resolves).

NOTES:
•  External pacing is the treatment of choice for symptomatic bradycardia if there is suspected

myocardial ischemia, or 2nd or 3rd degree AV blocks are present.

•  Can be given IM in thigh for suspected organophosphate poisoning /nerve agent exposure.
•  Note: the primary cause of bradycardia in pediatric patients is hypoxia.
Atropine is no longer recommended for adult or pediatric asystole.
