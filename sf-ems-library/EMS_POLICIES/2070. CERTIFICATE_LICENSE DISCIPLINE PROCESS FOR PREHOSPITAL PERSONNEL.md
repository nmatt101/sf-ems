IV.POLICY REGARDING EMT-P LICENSES

(A)  Grounds for Discipline.  The State EMS Authority may deny,

suspend, or revoke any EMT-P license, or may place any EMT-P
license or license holder on probation upon the finding by the Director
of the State EMS Authority of any of the following actions, which
shall be considered evidence of a threat to the public health and
safety:

1.  Fraud in the procurement of any certificate or license under this
division;
2.  Gross negligence;
3.  Repeated negligent acts;
4.  Incompetence;
5.  The commission of any fraudulent, dishonest, or corrupt act which is
substantially related to the qualifications, functions, and duties of
prehospital personnel;
6.  Conviction of any crime that is substantially related to the
qualifications, functions, and duties of prehospital personnel. The record
of conviction or a certified copy of the record shall be conclusive evidence
of the conviction;

a)  For the purposes of denial, placement on probation,
suspension, or revocation of a certificate, pursuant to California
Health and Safety Code §1798.200, a crime or act shall be
considered to be substantially related to the qualifications,
functions, or duties of a certificate holder if to a substantial degree
it evidences present or potential unfitness of a certificate holder to
perform the functions authorized by the certificate in a manner
consistent with the public health and safety. (22 CCR §100208(a)).
For the purposes of a crime, the record of conviction or a certified
copy of the record shall be conclusive evidence of such conviction.
“Crime” means any act in violation of the penal laws of this state,
any other state, or federal laws. This also means violation(s) of any
statute that imposes criminal penalties for such violations.
“Conviction” means the final judgment on a verdict of finding of
guilty, a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere. (22 CCR
§100208(b)).

or abetting the violation of, or conspiring to violate, any provision of this
division or the regulations adopted by the authority pertaining to
prehospital personnel;
8.  Violating or attempting to violate any federal or state statute or
regulation which regulates narcotics, dangerous drugs, or controlled
substances;
9.  Addiction to the excessive use of, or the misuse of, alcoholic
beverages, narcotics, dangerous drugs, or controlled substances;
10. Functioning outside the supervision of medical control in the field care
system operating at the local level, except as authorized by any other
license or certification;
11. Demonstration of irrational behavior or occurrence of a physical
disability to the extent that a reasonable and prudent person would have
reasonable cause to believe that the ability to perform the duties normally
expected may be impaired;

Page 2 of 13

Policy Reference No.: 2070
Effective Date:  November 1, 2010

12. Unprofessional conduct exhibited by any of the following: (A) The
mistreatment or physical abuse of any patient resulting from force in
excess of what a reasonable and prudent person trained and acting in a
similar capacity while engaged in the performance of his or her duties
would use if confronted with a similar circumstance. Nothing in this
section shall be deemed to prohibit an EMT-1 or EMT-P from assisting a
peace officer, or a peace officer who is acting in the dual capacity of peace
officer and EMT-I or EMT-P, from using that force that is reasonably
necessary to effect a lawful arrest or detention; (B) The failure to maintain
confidentiality of patient medical information, except as disclosure is
otherwise permitted or required by law in Sections 56 to 56.6, inclusive, of
the Civil Code; (C) The commission of any sexually related offense
specified under Section 290 of the Penal Code. (California Health and
Safety Code §1798.200 (b-c)).
Evaluation by Medical Director.  When information comes to the
attention of the Medical Director of the EMS Agency that an EMT-P
license holder has committed any act or omission that appears to
constitute grounds for disciplinary action under Division 2.5 of the
California Health and Safety Code, the Medical Director of the EMS
Agency may evaluate the information to determine if there is reason to
believe that disciplinary action may be necessary. (California Health and
Safety Code §1798.201(a)).

(B)

(C)  Recommendation by Medical Director.  If the Medical Director of the

EMS Agency sends a recommendation to the State EMS Authority for
further investigation or discipline of the license holder, the
recommendation shall include all documentary evidence collected by the
Medical Director in evaluating whether or not to make that
recommendation. The recommendation and accompanying evidence shall
be deemed in the nature of an investigative communication and be
protected by Section 6254 of the California Government Code.  In
deciding what level of disciplinary action is appropriate in the case, the
Authority shall consult with the Medical Director of the EMS Agency.
(California Health and Safety Code §1798.201(b)).

(D)  Temporary suspension

1.  Authority. The director of the State EMS Authority or the Medical
Director of the EMS Agency, after consultation with the relevant
employer, may temporarily suspend, prior to hearing, any EMT-P license
upon a determination that: (1) the licensee has engaged in acts or
omissions that constitute grounds for revocation of the EMT-P license;
and (2) permitting the licensee to continue to engage in the licensed
activity, or permitting the licensee to continue in the licensed activity
without restriction, would present an imminent threat to the public health
or safety. (California Health and Safety Code §1798.202(a)).
2.  Notice.  When the suspension is initiated by the EMS Agency, the
EMS Agency shall notify the licensee that his or her EMT-P license is
suspended and shall identify the reasons therefore. Within three (3)
working days of the initiation of the suspension by the EMS Agency, the
EMS Agency shall transmit to the State EMS Authority, via facsimile
transmission or overnight mail, all documentary evidence collected by the
EMS Agency relative to the decision to temporarily suspend. Within two
(2) working days of receipt of the EMS Agency's documentary evidence,
the director of the State EMS Authority shall determine the need for the
licensure action. Part of that determination shall include an evaluation of

Page 3 of 13

Policy Reference No.: 2070
Effective Date:  November 1, 2010

the need for continuance of the suspension during the licensure action
review process. If the director of the State EMS Authority determines that
the temporary suspension order should not continue, the State EMS
Authority shall immediately notify the licensee that the temporary
suspension is lifted. If the director of the State EMS Authority determines
that the temporary suspension order should continue, the State EMS
Authority shall immediately notify the licensee of the decision to continue
the temporary suspension and shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days of
receipt of the EMS Agency's documentary evidence, serve the licensee
with a temporary suspension order and accusation pursuant to California
Government Code §§ 11503, 11505, 11507. Within fifteen (15) days after
service of the accusation the respondent may file with the State EMS
Authority a Notice of Defense pursuant to California Government Code §
11506. (California Health and Safety Code §1798.202 (b)). If the
respondent files a notice of defense, the respondent shall be entitled to a
hearing on the merits within thirty (30) days of the State EMS Authority's
receipt of the notice of defense (California Government Code §11506;
California Health and Safety Code §1798.202 (d)).
Suspension or Revocation of Accreditation. The Medical Director of
the EMS Agency may suspend or revoke the accreditation of an EMT-P
license holder if the paramedic does not maintain current licensure or
meet local accreditation requirements.  The paramedic shall be granted
the same due process rights afforded EMT-1 certificate holders facing
suspension or revocation as set out below in Sections V., H of this Policy.
(22 CCR §100165(i)).
Employer Reporting of Disciplinary Actions and Investigations.

  (c)  For purposes of this section, "disciplinary cause or reason" means only an action
that is substantially related to the qualifications, functions, and duties of a paramedic
and is considered evidence of a threat to the public health and safety as identified in
subdivision (c) of Section 1798.200.
  (d)  Pursuant to subdivision (i) of Section 1798.24 of the Civil Code, upon
notification to the paramedic, the Authority may share the results of its investigation
into a paramedic's misconduct with the paramedic's employer, prospective employer
when requested in writing as part of a pre-employment background check, and the

or was working for at the time of the incident under review, as an EMT, either as a paid
employee or as a volunteer.  For purposes of this policy, "disciplinary plan" means a
written plan of action that can be taken by a relevant employer as a consequence of any
action listed in H&S Code Sec. 1798.200(c).

Under the provisions of Cal. Code of Regulations, Chapter 6, relevant employers:
(a) May conduct investigations, according to the requirements of Chapter 6, to determine
disciplinary cause.
(b) Upon determination of disciplinary cause, the relevant employer may develop and
implement, a disciplinary plan, in accordance with the Model Disciplinary Orders
(MDOs).  "Model Disciplinary Orders" means the "RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES FOR
DISCIPLINARY ORDERS AND CONDITIONS OF PROBATION FOR EMT (BASIC) AND
ADVANCED EMT" (EMSA document #134, 4/1/2010) which were developed to provide
consistent and equitable discipline in cases dealing with disciplinary cause.

(1) The relevant employer shall submit that disciplinary plan, along with the relevant
findings of the investigation related to disciplinary cause to the EMS Agency that
issued the certificate, within three (3) working days of adoption of the disciplinary
plan.  In the case where the certificate was issued by a non-LEMSA certifying entity,
the disciplinary plan shall be submitted to the San Francisco EMS Agency.

jurisdiction in the county in which the headquarters of the certifying entity is located,
shall conduct investigations to validate allegations for disciplinary cause when the
certificate holder is not an employee of a relevant employer or the relevant employer does
not conduct an investigation.   Upon determination of disciplinary cause, the medical
director may take certification action as necessary against an EMT certificate.
(b) The medical director may, upon determination of disciplinary cause and according to
the provisions of this policy, take certification action against an EMT to deny, suspend,
or revoke, or place a certificate holder on probation, upon the findings by the medical
director of the occurrence of any of the actions listed in Health and Safety Code, Section
1798.200 (c) and for which any of the following conditions are true:

(1) The relevant employer, after conducting an investigation, failed to impose
discipline for the conduct under investigation, or the medical director makes a
determination that discipline imposed by the relevant employer was not in accordance
with the MDOs and the conduct of the certificate holder constitutes grounds for
certification action.
(2) The medical director determines, following an investigation conducted in
accordance with this policy, that the conduct requires certification action.
(c) The medical director, after consultation with the relevant employer or without
consultation when no relevant employer exists, may temporarily suspend, prior to a
hearing, an EMT certificate upon a determination of the following:

(1) The certificate holder has engaged in acts or omissions that constitute grounds for
revocation of the EMT certificate; and
(2) Permitting the certificate holder to continue to engage in certified activity without
restriction poses an imminent threat to the public health and safety.

(d) If the medical director takes any certification action the medical director shall notify
the Authority of the findings of the investigation and the certification action taken by
entering it directly into the Central Registry by the EMS Agency within three (3) days
(Health & Safety Code § 1797.211) (22 CCR § 100209).

has jurisdiction in the county in which the alleged violation occurred within three
(3) working days, of the EMT’s name, certification number, and the allegation(s).
(b) The EMS Agency that receives any complaint against an EMT shall forward
the original complaint and any supporting documentation to the relevant employer
for investigation pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, if there is a relevant
employer, within three (3) working days of receipt of the information.  If there is
no relevant employer or the relevant employer does not wish to investigate the
complaint, the medical director shall evaluate the information received from a
credible source, including but not limited to, information obtained from an

Page 8 of 13

Policy Reference No.: 2070
Effective Date:  November 1, 2010

possibility of a threat to the public health and safety by the action of an applicant
for, or holder of, a certificate issued pursuant to this policy.
(c) The relevant employer or medical director shall conduct an investigation of the
allegations in accordance with the provisions of this policy, if warranted.
(d) Statewide public safety agencies shall provide the State EMS Authority with
current relevant employer contact information for their individual agencies. (22
CCR §100210).

H.  Due Process. The certification action process shall be in accordance with Chapter 5
(commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government
Code, known as the Administrative Procedure Act. (22 CCR § 100211.1)
Within 15 days of receipt of the negative disposition letter signed by the EMSA Medical
Director, the applicant or EMT has  the right to file with the EMS Agency, in writing and
by certified mail, a response to this decision, known as a “notice of defense”, in which he
or she may:

1.  Request a hearing, which would be conducted by an Administrative Law Judge
(ALJ) from the State Office of Administrative Hearings ;Object to all or parts of
the Summary of Findings contained in the disposition letter;

2.  Admit to the Summary of Findings in whole or in part; or,
3.  Present new matter by way of defense.

Section 11506 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides the complete details
regarding these options.
A formal hearing is a review process before an ALJ selected by the State Office of
Administrative Hearings. The ALJ hearing reviews all of the available information.  The
applicant or EMT has the right to be represented by legal counsel or to be accompanied to
the ALJ hearing by any person to provide advice and support. The ALJ then prepares a
written report containing findings, makes recommendations, and submits the matter to the
Medical Director. The ALJ may recommend a more lenient, more harsh or similar
sanctions to the ones contained in the disposition letter.  The Medical Director retains the
final decision-making authority.

I. Determination of Certification Action

(a) A certification action relative to the individual's certificate(s) shall be taken as
a result of the findings of the investigation.
(b) Upon determining the disciplinary or certification action to be taken as

purposes by the relevant employer or EMS Agency, a statement certifying the
decision made and the date the decision was made. The decision must contain
findings of fact and a determination of issues, together with the disciplinary plan
and the date the disciplinary plan shall take effect.
(c) In the case of a temporary suspension order pursuant to 22 CCR Section
100209 (c), it shall take effect upon the date the notice required by 22 CCR
Section 100213 is mailed to the certificate holder.

FIREFIGHTERS PROCEDURAL BILL OF RIGHTS

A.
Bill of Rights Act (FPBRA),” shall be adhered to for the following:

Government Code Sections 3250-3262, known as the “Firefighters Procedural

Page 12 of 13

Policy Reference No.: 2070
Effective Date:  November 1, 2010

1.  All Civil Service firefighter job classifications in the San Francisco Fire

Department, except those employees on probationary status.

2.  Non-firefighter job classifications in the SFFD are not covered by this act.
However, the EMS Agency will follow FPBRA for paramedics and EMT’s who are not
firefighters and who have passed their probationary period.

3.  Firefighter positions in the Presidio Fire Department, National Park Service

and U.S. Department of the Interior are covered.

4.  The rights and protections in the FPBRA shall only apply to a firefighter

during events and circumstances involving the performance of his or her official duties.

B.  For those firefighter/EMT’s subject to the FPBRA,  a “Notice” document and an
“Admonishment of Rights” document shall be given to him or her prior to the
commencement of an investigation.  It shall adhere to the provisions of the FPBRA at
Government Code § 3250-3262.

C.  Punitive action on grounds other than merit shall not be undertaken for any act,
omission, or other allegation of misconduct if the investigation of the allegation is not
completed within one year of discovery by EMSA.  If EMSA determines that a punitive
action may be taken, EMSA shall complete its investigation and notify the
applicant/certificate holder of its proposed punitive action within that year.

D.  If a certificate holder covered under the FPBRA is being investigated for a matter that
may lead to criminal prosecution, the EMSA may request from local and/or federal
prosecutors a formal grant of immunity from criminal prosecution regarding any
information and evidence that may result from the EMSA investigation.  Subject to that
grant of immunity from criminal prosecution, a certificate holder refusing to respond to
questions or submit to interrogations shall be informed that the failure to answer
questions directly related to the investigation or interrogation may result in punitive
action.  (22 CCR § 100211; Government Code § 3250-3262, 3253(e) (1)
