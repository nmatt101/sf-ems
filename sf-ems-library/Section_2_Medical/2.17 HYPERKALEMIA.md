Notes

Bradycardia
Peaked T waves
Prolonged QRS (>0.12 sec) that may progress to sine wave in severe cases

Suspect hyperkalemia in patients with history of kidney disease, dialysis, or crush syndrome with any ECG findings:
•
•
•
And/or
•

Recent potassium value >6.0mEq (with or without above ECG findings)

•  Anytime Sodium Bicarbonate is administered, the IV should be flushed before and after.
•
•

In cases of ECG changes in hyperkalemia, Calcium should always be given prior to Sodium Bicarbonate
Calcium should always be given first with any ECG changes

HYPERKALEMIA WITHOUT CARDIAC ARREST

Suspect hyperkalemia in patients with a history of kidney disease, dialysis, or crush syndrome
with any of the following clinical ﬁndings on ECG or cardiac monitor:

Bradycardia
Peaked T waves
Prolonged QRS (> 0.12 sec), that may progress to sine wave in severe cases (see example

o
o
o
below)

And/or

o

Recent potassium value > 6.0 mEq (with or without the presence of above ECG ﬁndings)

The following approach should be taken for a patient in suspected hyperkalemia especially with ECG
findings:

Calcium Chloride

Adult: 1g IV/IO. May repeat every 5 minutes until ECG changes improve, up to a
cumulative amount of 4g
Pediatric: 20 mg/kg IV/IO up to 1g per dose over 5 minutes. May repeat every 5
minutes up to cumulative dose of 4g

Lastly, give medication to shift potassium intracellularly:

Albuterol 5mg/6ml NS via nebulizer over 5 to 15 minutes, repeated 3 times.
Sodium Bicarbonate:

Adult:  50mEq IV/IO one time dose
Pediatric: 1mEq/kg (max 50mEq) IV/IO one time dose

The following approach should be taken for a patient in suspected hyperkalemia without ECG
changes,

Give medication to shift potassium intracellularly:

Albuterol:5mg/6ml NS via nebulizer over 5 to 15 minutes, repeated 3 times.
Sodium Bicarbonate:
                      Adult 50mEq IV/IO one time dose

Pediatric: 1mEq/kg (max 50mEq) IV/IO one time dose

Refer to protocol 2.04 – Cardiac Arrest for detailed treatment information.

HYPERKALEMIA WITH CARDIAC ARREST

Notes

•  Calcium should always be given ﬁrst with any of the ECG ﬁndings noted above
•  Anytime Sodium Bicarbonate is administered, the IV should be ﬂushed before and after. In
cases of ECG changes in hyperkalemia, Calcium should always be given prior to Sodium
Bicarbonate
