ADENOSINE (Adenocard)

  ACTION: Antiarrhythmic
•  Decreases conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node interrupting re-entry

pathways.
Interrupts and may convert paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).

•

INDICATIONS:
•  Hemodynamically stable PSVT.
•  Hemodynamically unstable PSVT as substitute for cardioversion
•  Hemodynamically stable VT with a pulse (Pediatric only)

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
•  2nd or 3rd degree AV block
•  Sick sinus syndrome.
•  Polymorphic wide complex tachycardia
•  Do not use Adenosine on a patient with a known history of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW)

syndrome.

POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
•  Transient asystole (up to 20 to 30 secs.)
•
•  Chest pressure

Facial flushing and headaches

•
•
•

Hypotension
Dyspnea and bronchospasms
Nausea

ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
➔  First dose: 6 mg rapid IVP/IO* followed with 20 ml Normal Saline flush.
➔  If first dose is ineffective, repeat with 12 mg rapid IVP/IO. * May repeat 12mg x 1 if still

ineffective.

  PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:

➔  First dose: 0.1 mg/kg rapid IVP/IO*followed by 10ml NS flush (max first dose 6 mg).
➔  If first dose is ineffective, repeat with 0.2 mg/kg rapid IVP/IO* (max second dose 12 mg).

May repeat 0.2 mg/kg x 1 if still ineffective.

NOTES:
•  Clinically evaluate patients—adult and pediatric—to distinguish primary tachyarrhythmias

such as PSVT—from patient conditions leading to sinus tachycardias.

•  Adenosine is blocked by methylxanthines (caffeine) and potentiated by dipyridamole and

carbamazepine.

* IV preferred route, ideally at, or proximal to, the antecubital fossa
