8.07 PEDIATRIC CARDIAC ARREST

BLS Treatment

• If neonate see Protocol 8.05 Neonatal Resusitation

• Assess circulation, airway, breathing, and responsiveness.
• Oxygen (high flow via BVM with BLS airway as indicated)
• High quality CPR:

• 15:2 ratio
• Push hard (≥ 1/3 of anteroposterior diameter of chest), fast (100-120/min) and allow

complete chest recoil
• Minimize interruptions
• Perform pulse & rhythm checks q 2 minutes
• Change compressor q 2min, or sooner if fatigued.

• Apply AED/Defibrillator, use pediatric pads, if available

ALS Treatment

Current Pediatric Advanced Life Support should be followed in conjunction with this protocol

Energy for Defibrillation

•

If in a shockable rhythm, defibrillate

• First shock 2 J/kg

• Second shock 4 J/kg.

• After 4J/kg, each subsequent shocks should be increased by 2 J/kg (Maximum 10 J/kg)

Medication/Fluid Therapy

• Epinephrine: 0.01 mg/kg IVP/IO (0.01mg/1 mL). Maximum single dose 1mg. May repeat q3-5

min throughout resuscitation.
IV/ IO Normal Saline fluid bolus: IV/IO bolus of 20ml/kg. Repeat up to 60ml/kg if indicated
•
• Amiodarone 5mg/kg IVP/IO. Maximum total dose 300mg. May repeat up to 3 doses total.

•

If amiodarone is unavailable: Lidocaine 1mg/kg IV/IO with no repeat dose

• Advanced airway if indicated. Protocol 7.01 Airway Management

Advanced Airway

• For patients with advanced airways administer breaths at age-appropriate rate and

monitor with EtCO2 to assess compression quality and for signs of ROSC

• For patients less than 8 years old:

• Supraglottic Airway for patients greater than 28 days old who cannot be adequately

managed with a BLS airway
For patients greater than 8 years old:

•

• Use of advanced airway interventions as indicated in the following order. No more
than two attempts at any one intervention before moving to an alternate approach

Supraglottic Airway

1.
2. Oral Endotracheal Intubation

After Care if ROSC
Go to Protocol 2.05 Adult and Pediatric Post-Cardiac Arrest or Return of Spontaneous Circulation
(ROSC)

In addition to ongoing PALS, consider additional treatments for reversible causes

Hypoxia:

• Bag-mask ventilation with O2.
•

Insert airway adjuncts as appropriate.

Hydrogen Ion (Acidosis): Assure adequate ventilation to blow off CO2.

Hypovolemia: Give Normal Saline bolus. If secondary to blood loss, early transport

Hypothermia: Rewarm if patient is hypothermic.

Hyperkalemia: Give Calcium Chloride

•

•

Consider Sodium Bicarbonate only after Calcium Chloride when treating suspected
hyperkalemia
Consider Albuterol via BVM

Hypoglycemia: Check blood glucose and correct hypoglycemia per Protocol 8.02 Pediatric Altered
Mental status

Torsades de Pointes: After defibrillation give  Magnesium Sulfate

Toxins: Treat signs and symptoms of drug toxicity:

•

•
•

If QRS widening from Tricyclic Antidepressant Overdose, give Sodium Bicarbonate. May
repeat.
If calcium channel blocker overdose, give Calcium Chloride. May repeat q 5 minutes.
If opiate overdose is suspected, give Naloxone. Do not give to neonates

Base Hospital Contact Criteria

Discontinuation of resuscitation efforts.
