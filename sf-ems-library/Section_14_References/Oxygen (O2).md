ACTION:  Medical Gas

Oxygen (O2)

•  Essential for cellular metabolism and survival.
•  First drug used for respiratory compromise, or any time hypoxia is possible.

INDICATIONS:

•  All patients with cardiopulmonary emergencies.
•  Respiratory emergencies, including any patient who complains of shortness of breath.
•  Chest pain.
•  Suspected hypoxemia.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:

•  Do NOT withhold oxygen from anyone who might need it.

ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:

Nasal Cannula:  2 to 6 liters/min (delivers 24 to 44% oxygen). 15 LPM for apneic oxygenation
during endotracheal intubation
Nonrebreather Mask:  10 to 15 liters/min (delivers 85 to 95% oxygen).
  BVM with O2 Reservoir:  15 to 25 liters/min (delivers 85 to 95% oxygen).

PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:

Nasal Cannula: 2 to 4 liters/min (delivers 24 to 38% oxygen). 15 LPM for apneic oxygenation
during endotracheal intubation
Nonrebreather Mask:  10 to 12 liters/min (delivers 85 to 95% oxygen).
BVM with O2 Reservoir: 10 to 15 liters/min (delivers 60 to 95% oxygen).

NOTES:

•  Target oxygen saturation levels when administering O2 is 94 – 95%.
•  Never withhold oxygen from anyone who might need it.
•  Observe COPD patients closely and be prepared to ventilate them with BVM if necessary

(development of apnea or increasing signs of respiratory failure).

•  Apneic oxygenation during intubation should be delivered whenever two sources of oxygen

are readily available.
