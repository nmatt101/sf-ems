VENTILATOR MANAGEMENT

1. PURPOSE

To authorize CCP’s to initiate, monitor, and adjust ventilators

2. POLICY

2.1. CCP’s are permitted to initiate non-invasive and invasive ventilator management.
2.2. CCP’s are permitted to monitor and adjust ventilator settings in all modes.

3. 3. PRECAUTIONS

3.1. The CCP is responsible for all airway management and must frequently reassess ETT

placement, breath sounds, and EtCO2 plus with each patient movement.

4. PROCEDURE

4.1. Ventilator support must be regulated by a ventilator familiar to the CCP and approved by local

EMS agency.

4.2. In the event of a ventilator failure that cannot be corrected, the CCP will discontinue use of
the ventilator and initiate ventilation by BVM with a PEEP valve device and notify the
transferring or base hospital physician.

4.3. CCP’s may utilize the transport ventilator to initiate BiPAP/CPAP/RAM cannula in NIPPV

mode or ventilator support for intubated patients in IPPV mode.

4.4. Personnel shall monitor PSI level in the main and portable oxygen cylinder(s).
4.5. Patients shall be placed and maintained on the cardiac monitor, EtCO2, and pulse oximetry
monitored during transport. VTE’s and PIP’s must be documented along with vital signs per
protocol.

4.6. CCP’s shall continually observe the patient and document patient response to any changes.
4.7. CCP’s shall chart the initial vent settings and any subsequent changes.
4.8. CCP’s may adjust ventilator settings consistent with the patient’s ABG values and current
practice standards to maximize oxygenation, ventilation, and compliance. In general,
appropriate settings are as follows:
• Consider use of pressure control (PC) at 10-15 for all patients with interstitial lung disease.
• Mode: SIMV, not AC, is the preferred mode of transport. AC can cause inadvertent breath

stacking/triggering.

• Rate: Typically set between 12-20 for adults, 20-40 for peds, and 30-60 for infants. Monitor

and adjust for target EtCO2.

• Tidal Volume (Vte): Set at 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight. For ARDS or excessive pressure

•

etiologies consider 4-6 ml/kg.
Inspiratory Time (I-times):
o Neonate 0.30-0.40
o Infant 0.40-0.50
o Pediatric 0.60-0.80
o Adult 0.8-1.0 (max 1.5)
o Based on age and disease process. Longer I-times can help contribute to recruitment

and an increased mean airway pressure (Paw).

• FiO2: Set to maximize oxygenation and keep SpO2 between 94-99%. Patients should not

routinely be set on, and maintained at, 100% FiO2.

• Alarms: High pressure set 10 above actual PIPs and low pressure set 10 below PIP’s.
• PEEP: Set at a minimum of 5cm H2O (intrinsic PEEP) for adults/pediatrics and at 3cm
H2O for infants. Patients with pulmonary edema, ARDS, and poor oxygenation may
require higher PEEPS.

5. SPECIAL INFORMATION

5.1. The ventilator that the provider is to use should be able to match the existing ventilator

settings. The following minimum device features (including circuit) must be present for this
category:
• Set rate of ventilations
• Adjustable delivered tidal volume
• Adjustable inspiratory and expiratory ratios (I:E ratio)
• Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP)
• Peak airway pressure gauge
• Modes:

o Assist Control (AC)
o Pressure Control (PC)
o Pressure Regulated Volume Control (PRVC)
o Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV)
o Controlled Mechanical Ventilation (CMV)
o Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
o Bi-Level Positive Airway pressure (BiPAP)

• Alarms:

o Peak airway pressure
o Disconnect

• Strongly recommended option: Blend percentage oxygen

5.2. Agencies using this equipment must be certain to follow the manufacturer’s instructions

regarding use, maintenance, cleaning, and regular testing of the device.
• The units must be inspected and tested after every patient use.
• The units must be disinfected after use unless a disposable unit is used.
• The units shall undergo preventative resting and maintenance by qualified personnel

annually.
o Agencies shall arrange for (at least) annual inspections and testing of the equipment
by a manufacturer’s representative (or designee). Documentation of this service shall
be maintained in a service log. This record shall be kept by each agency using ATV’s.

5.3. CCP’s must receive a thorough initial and continual ventilator training. Such training shall
occur, at a minimum, annually. Training shall be documented and on file with provider.
