Subject: Dispatch of Mutual Aid Ambulances

In advance of the 2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and several other recent surge events,
the San Francisco EMS Agency is providing additional guidance for utilization of mutual aid ambulances
including BLS units, corporate resources, and ambulance strike teams. As a few reminders:

During periods of adequate ambulance levels and for ALS coded calls, ALS Ambulances shall be
dispatched to EMS Incidents based solely on closest available unit. This is imperative for compliance
with our EMS Plan approved the EMS Authority.

BLS Ambulances shall be used, for calls such as minor injuries or illness, in advance of exhausting ALS
resources. If a BLS ambulance will meet the response time for a BLS-coded call, use the BLS resource.
Maximizing ALS availability for high acuity calls during low ambulance levels can be a life-saving decision.
Using BLS early, prior to exhaustion of ALS, will help keep ALS resources available hours later as lower
acuity calls have a higher likelihood of extended patient offload times.

The EMS Agency appreciates your cooperation during times of anticipated pressure on the EMS System.
For any questions, please contact the EMS Agency.
