Subject: Annual Random Ambulance Inspections

The San Francisco EMS Agency will begin Random Ambulance Inspections in late January 2025.
The inspection period will conclude when 30 percent of each provider’s ﬂeet has been reached.

Inspections are primarily conducted at hospitals, take approximately 10 minutes, and may occur
while a crew is ﬁnishing “decon” and documentation to avoid impacts to the 9-1-1 system.
Inspection checklists consist of a small, randomized sample of items, as listed in EMS Agency
Policy 4001a, to ensure ambulances meet or exceed minimum equipment requirements.

Please email Sal Serrian (salvatore.serrian@sfgov.org), primary point of contact for ambulance
permitting and inspections, with any questions or concerns.
