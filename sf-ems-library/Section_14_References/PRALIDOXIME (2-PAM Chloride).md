NOTES:
•  Large amounts of Atropine/2-PAM may be needed to adequately treat symptoms of nerve

agent poisoning.

•  Each injector carries 2.1mg Atropine and 600mg Pralidoxime.
•  Titrate dose to effect.
•  Give atropine first.
•  Do not administer to asymptomatic patients.
•  Medication effects start within 1-5min following administration.
•  Most effective if given early before irreversible binding of nerve agent with

acetylcholinesterase (“aging”) occurs, but may be administered up to 48 hours post
exposure in symptomatic patients.

•  Bronchospasm and respiratory secretions are the best acute symptoms to monitor response

to Atropine/2-PAM therapy:

o  Decreased bronchospasm and respiratory secretions = Getting Better.
o  No change or increased bronchospasm and respiratory secretions = Needs more 2-

PAM
