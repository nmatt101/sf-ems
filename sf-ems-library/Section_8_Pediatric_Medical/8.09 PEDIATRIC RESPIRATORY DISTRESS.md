8.09 PEDIATRIC RESPIRATORY DISTRESS

BLS Treatment

•  Assess airway, breathing, circulations and responsiveness.
•  Assess vital signs.
•  Position of comfort.
•  NPO
•  Oxygen as indicated.

ALS Treatment

Current American Heart Association Guidelines concerning Emergency Cardiac Care
assessments and interventions shall always take precedence over local protocols when there
is a conflict concerning techniques of resuscitation.

•  Wheezing with signs of severe distress?

a.  Mild: Increase work of breathing, regular respiratory rate, alert and active.
b.  Moderate: increased work of breathing, increased respiratory rate, alert and active.
c.  Severe: increased work of breathing, increased respiratory rate, agitated, pale,

anaphylaxis.

d.  Life Threatening: increased work of breathing, increased respiratory rate, drowsy or

confused, not moving, cyanosis, anaphylaxis.

If secondary to anaphylaxis see 8.01 Pediatric Allergic Reaction /Anaphylaxis

•
•  Consider CPAP for patients 8 years and older.
•  Children <2 with suspected bronchiolitis: suction nose. Note: albuterol may be ineffective
•  Monitor with pulse oximeter and end tidal CO2.
•  Consider blood glucose check to rule out metabolic causes of tachypnea, such as DKA.
•  Albuterol: mild to moderate distress with MDI available: 2-3 puffs (~ 6 breaths between

each puff) q5min.

a.  If MDI unavailable administer 2.5mg/3mL NS via nebulizer over 5 to 15 minutes. For

continued wheezing, may repeat as needed.

•  Epinephrine (for severe or life-threatening respiratory distress) <30 kg=0.15/IM OR

>30KG=0.3mg/IM.

•  Anaphylaxis: may repeat x1 in 5 min.
•  Bronchospasm: may repeat x2 q20 min

•  Albuterol: administer 2.5mg/3ml NS via nebulizer over 5 to 15 min.
