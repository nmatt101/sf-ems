1.02 PATIENT ASSESSMENT –SECONDARY SURVEY

The secondary survey is the systematic assessment and complaint-focused relevant physical
examination of the patient.

•  The Primary Survey and initial treatment and stabilization of life-threatening airway,

breathing and circulation difficulties.

•  Need for Spinal Motion Restriction.
•  A rapid trauma assessment (if indicated by related trauma protocol).
•  Transport of the potentially unstable or critical patient.
•
•  An initial set of vital signs:

Investigation of the chief complaint and associated complaints, signs or symptoms.

o  Pulse.
o  Blood pressure.
o  Respiration.
o  Lung sounds.
o  Pupils.
o  Cardiac rhythm (if indicated by related protocol).
o  Pulse oximetry.
o  ETC02 if indicated
o  Blood Glucose (if indicated by related protocol).
o  Determine Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) Score:

Eye Opening

4 = Spontaneous
3 = To verbal stimuli
2 = To painful stimuli
1 = No Response

Verbal Response

5 = Oriented
4 = Confused
3 = Inappropriate words
2 = Incomprehensible words
1 = No Response

USING THE GCS TO ASSESS INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN:

Eye Opening

4 = Spontaneous

3 = To verbal stimuli

2 = To painful stimuli
1 = No response

Verbal Response

5 = Smiles, oriented to sounds, follows objects,
interacts
4 = Cries but is consolable; inappropriate
interactions
3 = Inconsistently consolable, moaning
2 = Inconsolable, agitated
1 = No vocal response

HISTORY
•  Obtain Patient History from available sources.
•  Allergies.
•  Medications. Past medical history relevant to chief complaint
•  Assessment questions, if appropriate:

Motor Response

6 = Obeys Commands
5 = Purposeful / Localizes pain
4 = Withdraws to pain
3 = Flexion to pain
2 = Extension to pain
1 = No Response

Motor Response

6 = Obeys Commands

5 = Purposeful/Localizes pain

4 = Withdrawal from pain
3 = Flexion to pain
2 = Extension to pain
1 = No motor response

1.02 PATIENT ASSESSMENT –SECONDARY SURVEY

o  OPQRST (location, factors that increase or decrease the pain severity and a pain

scale.)

▪  O= Onset (Sudden or gradual)
▪  P= Provoke (What were you doing when the pain started? Does anything

make it better or worse?)

▪  Q= Quality (What does the pain feel like?)
▪  R= Region/Radiate (Where is the pain? Does it go anywhere else?)
▪  S= Severity (On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst pain you have ever had,
how would you rate that pain now? How would you rate that pain at its
worst or during exertion/movement?)
▪  T= Time (When or what time did this start?)

o  PASTE (Used for Shortness of Breath Assessment)
▪  P= Progression (Sudden or gradual?)
▪  A= Assoc. Chest Pain (If yes, which came first?)
▪  S= Sputum (Are you coughing anything up? If yes, what color is it?)
▪  T= Time, Temp, Talkability (When or what time did this start? Have you had

or do you have a fever? How many word sentences can the patient speak in?)

▪  E= Exercise tolerance (What is the patient’s tolerance for exertion? Can they
get up and walk without getting SOB? What is their baseline tolerance level?)

•  Mechanism of injury (as indicated by relevant protocol).

For focused history findings relevant to specific patient complaints, see protocols
related to each chief complaint.

EXPOSE, EXAMINE & EVALUATE:
•  Minimize on scene time for trauma patients
•  All physical assessments for trauma should determine the presence or absence of DCAP-

BTLS:

o  Deformity
o  Contusion/Crepitus
o  Abrasion
o  Puncture
o  Bruising/Bleeding
o  Tenderness
o  Laceration
o  Swelling

•

In situations with suspected life threatening trauma mechanism, a rapid trauma assessment
should be performed:
o  Expose head, trunk, and extremities.
o  Rapid Trauma Assessment looking for and treating life threatening injuries.
o  See relevant protocols for Head, Neck, Facial, Chest, Abdominal, Pelvis, and Extremity.

•  Treat any newly discovered life-threatening wounds.
