7.16 MECHANICAL CPR DEVICE

To establish standards for the use of a chest compression and cardiac catheterization lab-
capable mechanical CPR device. In each step of application, minimizing interruptions in
compressions is paramount. During use, CPR shall continue to be performed in accordance
with Protocol 2.04 – Cardiac Arrest.

INDICATIONS

•  When a decision is made by Paramedics or Base Physician to transport a cardiac arrest

patient with CPR in-progress, following prior initiation of CPR on scene

•  Cardiac arrest patients located in a confined space
•  Applied to ROSC patients for use if pulses are lost during extrication or transport
•  Other circumstances where use has been approved by Base Physician

CONTRAINDICATIONS

•
If it is not possible to position the device safely or correctly on the patient’s chest
•  The patient is too small: the device alerts with 3 fast tones when lowering the Suction

Cup, and you cannot enter the PAUSE mode or ACTIVE mode

•  The patient is too large: you cannot lock the device to the back plate without

compressing the chest

•  Cardiac arrest of traumatic etiology

PROCEDURE

1.  Ensure the chest is exposed prior to placement
2.  Power the device on (it will automatically enter ADJUST mode)
3.  Place the back plate underneath the patient, immediately below the armpits
4.  Maintaining manual compressions, attach the support leg nearest you to the back plate
5.  Attach the second support leg to the other side of the back plate
6.  Pull up once on the device to ensure parts are securely attached
7.  Adjust the height of the suction cup until the pressure pad touches the patient’s chest,

leaving defibrillation pads in place but remove the “puck”

8.  Push PAUSE to lock the device in the start position

Note: If suction cup requires adjustment due to improper placement, push ADJUST
(button on far left) to manually set the suction cup to the correct height and placement

9.  Use a permanent marker to mark the upper and lower edges of the suction cup on

patient’s chest in the starting position
Note: Markings will be referenced as landmarks to ensure suction cup is in appropriate
position

10. Push ACTIVE (continuous) or ACTIVE (30:2) to start compressions
11. Prior to patient movement, apply the neck stabilization strap and secure the arms to the

device using the straps on the support legs

12. Verify position of suction cup after each patient movement, device manipulation or

device re-engagement

FOR ROSC

1.  Push PAUSE to stop compressions
2.  Go to Protocol 2.05 – Adult Post-Cardiac Arrest or Return of Spontaneous Circulation
3.  Transport with device still attached to patient in case of loss of spontaneous circulation
