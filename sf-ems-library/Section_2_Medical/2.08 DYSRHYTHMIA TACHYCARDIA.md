2.08 DYSRHYTHMIA: TACHYCARDIA

BLS Treatment

•  Primary Survey: identify and immediately correct life threats
•  ABCs, vital signs and oxygen as indicated
•  Secondary Survey: relevant physical examination of the patient
•  Call for ALS resource if patient is symptomatic

ALS Treatment
Current Advanced Cardiac Life Support should be followed in conjunction with this protocol/algorithm

IV/IO with Normal Saline TKO, preferably at antecubital fossa.

•
•  12-lead EKG (If symptomatic, do not delay therapy in order to obtain 12 lead).
•  Treat if >150 BPM and patient is symptomatic.

STABLE REGULAR AND NARROW (QRS < 0.12 seconds):

•  Vagal maneuvers (Valsalva, cough or breath holding).
•  Adenosine

 STABLE REGULAR AND WIDE (QRS > 0.12 seconds):

•  Amiodarone
•  Give Magnesium Sulfate in suspected hypomagnesemia

 STABLE TORSADES de POINTES

Administer Magnesium Sulfate.

     HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE REGULAR: NARROW OR WIDE

•  Synchronized cardioversion (refer to Protocol 7.19 Cardioversion)

o  As a general guideline:

•  Narrow QRS and regular: start at 70J
•  Wide QRS and regular: start at 100J

•

If sedation is needed for awake patient during anticipated cardioversion strongly consider
Midazolam

If UNSTABLE, NARROW, REGULAR and synchronized cardioversion fails:

•  Administer Adenosine.

 If UNSTABLE REGULAR AND WIDE and synchronized cardioversion fails:

•  Administer Amiodarone.

 HEMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE IRREGULAR AND WIDE (Including Torsades de Pointes)

•

If unable to synchronize (including Torsades de Pointes) go directly to unsynchronized
cardioversion (defibrillation) starting at 120J
• Give Magnesium Sulfate for Torsades de Pointes

Contact Base Hospital physician if considering medications in addition to Midazolam for sedation.

Base Hospital Contact Criteria

Comments

• Only administer synchronized cardioversion for atrial fibrillation if patient is unstable.
• Hemodynamically unstable patients may be defined as a heart rate >150 bpm with associated signs and
symptoms: hypotension (<90 SBP), acutely altered mental status, signs of shock, significant ischemic
chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or pulmonary edema likely due to the arrhythmia.
• This protocol is not intended to treat tachycardia that is secondary to underlying conditions (e.g.
dehydration, trauma, sepsis or toxins)
• Do not use Adenosine in patients with 2nd or 3rd degree heart blocks, sick sinus syndrome,
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, or known history of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW)
• Midazolam is not contraindicated if SBP is < 90 if used for pre-procedural sedation
