Subject: Immediate Release Extension – Policy 4040 and Protocol 6.01

On September 16, 2024, the EMS Agency released Policy 4040 (Procedure and Documentation for Non-
Transported Patients) and Protocol 6.01 (Agitated/Violent Patient) for immediate release implementation on
October 1, 2024 to address impacts from SB 43 implementation.

Under Policy 1000 (Policy and Protocol Public Comment Process), an immediate release policy/protocol is
valid for 90 days from the initial effective date (October 1) and may be extended to a total of 180 days from
the initial date without public comment.

Key partners have been diligently working on additional but less urgent changes and enhancements to both
Policy 4040 and Protocol 6.01 that were not included as part of the October 1 release with an expected
implementation date of April 1, 2025. Due to the timeline for EMS Advisory Committee review in January
2025 and for additional workgroup feedback for the non-urgent changes, both Policy 4040 and Protocol
6.01 documents with effective dates of October 1 are being extended 180 days.

The EMS Agency remains committed to transparency and feedback. If you have any questions or concerns,
please do not hesitate to contact the EMS Agency.
