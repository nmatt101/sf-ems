POLICY REFERENCE NO: 4000.1

1.  PURPOSE

1.1.  To deﬁne the goals for ambulance turnaround and pa�ent oﬄoad times.

2.  BACKGROUND

2.1.  Patient transfer from ambulance to hospital is a critical part of emergency care, both for the

individual pa�ent at the hospital and to preserve the availability of ambulances to answer 911
calls for medical assistance throughout the San Francisco EMS System.

a pa�ent to a hospital emergency department.

3.4.  Oﬄoad �me interval - The period of �me between ambulance arrival at emergency

department and ambulance pa�ent oﬄoad �me.

could poten�ally expose a EMS personnel or pa�ent on a subsequent call. A decontamina�on
delay is not declared for rou�ne Code 2 transports or pa�ent care.

3.7.  Ambulance delayed in triage – No�ﬁca�on is made to DEC by ambulance crew that a back-up
