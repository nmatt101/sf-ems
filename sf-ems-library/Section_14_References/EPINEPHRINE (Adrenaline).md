EPINEPHRINE (Adrenaline)

ACTION: Sympathomimetic
•  Catecholamine that stimulates alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors.
•  Results in increased heart rate (positive chronotropy), systemic vascular resistance, and blood

pressure (positive inotropy). It also causes bronchodilation due to its effects on beta-2 adrenergic
receptors.

INDICATION
Cardiac arrest/Pediatric
Bradycardia

Anaphylaxis

Severe bronchospasm

Hypotension and shock
refractory to fluid bolus
(such has septic shock,
anaphylactic shock,
cardiogenic shock after
ROSC)

Symptomatic Bradycardia
For adult bradycardia only

ADULT
1 mg IVP/IO at the time
intervals specified in
Protocol 2.04 Cardiac
Arrest - Appendix 1. Use
0.1 mg/mL concentration.
0.3 mg IM
Use 1 mg/mL
concentration.
May repeat x1 in 5 min.

0.3 mg IM
Use 1 mg/mL
concentration. May repeat
x2 q20min.

Prepare 1 mcg/mL infusion
(see last page of
epinephrine reference).
Infuse at 1-3 drops/second
IV/IO (6-18 mL/min) using
10 drops/mL macrodrip
chamber.
Titrate to goal BP.

PEDIATRIC
0.01 mg/kg up to 1 mg IVP/IO every 3-5
minutes. Use 0.1 mg/mL concentration.

0.15 mg IM for weight < 30 kg
- or -
0.3 mg IM for weight ≥ 30 kg
Use 1 mg/mL concentration.
May repeat x1 in 5 min.
0.15 mg IM for weight < 30 kg
- or -
0.3 mg IM for weight ≥ 30 kg
Use 1 mg/mL concentration. May repeat
x2 q20min.
Prepare 1 mcg/mL infusion (see last
page of epinephrine reference).
Connect the liter bag to a buretrol or
similar device and fill the buretrol or
similar device with 100 mL of the mixed
solution. Infuse at 0.3 drops/kg/second
IV/IO (0.3 mL/kg/min) using the buretrol
or similar device.
Titrate to goal BP. (Use ADULT dosing for
weight greater than 20 kg.)

Not to be used in pediatric bradycardia

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
•  None in cardiac arrest or other life-threatening situations.
•  Use with caution for severe bronchospasm or allergic reactions in patients with coronary artery

disease since myocardial ischemia may be precipitated.
IV epinephrine should only be used in cardiac arrest . Use IM initially for patients with anaphylaxis.

•

POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
•  Tachydysrhythmias including V-Tach and

V-Fib

•  Hypertension
•  Nausea and vomiting

•
Increased myocardial O2 demand.
•  Extravasation causes tissue necrosis.
•  Headache and dizziness

NOTES:
•  Ratio expressions of medication concentration (e.g. 1:1000) are no longer preferred. For reference, 1

mg/mL = 1:1000 and 0.1 mg/mL = 1 mg/10 mL = 1:10000.

•  Do not run continuous infusion in same line as sodium bicarbonate.
•  Ensure that the patient is not hypovolemic before infusing.
•  After preparing a 1 mcg/mL infusion, label bag clearly to avoid confusion with normal saline.
•  Buretrols and similar devices have 60 drops per mL, so 1 drop/second is equivalent to 1 mL/min, or 1

mcg/min given an infusion concentration of 1 mcg/mL.
Intraosseous lines may need a pressure bag to obtain the target number of drops per minute.

•
•  The anterolateral thigh is the preferred location for IM epinephrine.

Epinephrine 1 mcg/mL infusion preparation

Inject 1 mL* of 1 mg/mL = 1 mg       OR        10 mL* of 0.1 mg/mL = 1 mg
into 1000 mL 0.9% sodium chloride and immediately label the infusion
to prevent confusion with normal saline.

*Note that the volume of the epinephrine solution is negligible when added to 1000 mL normal
saline. There is no need to remove normal saline from the 1000 mL bag as the final
concentration of epinephrine is not appreciably less than 1 mcg/mL.
