Subject: Triage to Alt. Destination and Community Paramedicine Accreditation Renewals (Fall 2025)

The intention of this memo is to clarify the timeline and process for Fall 2025 Community Paramedicine
(CP) and Triage to Alternate Destination (TAD) accreditation renewals. CP and TAD-accredited
Paramedics must renew their credentials every two years. The county’s first CP/TAD accreditations took
place in the Fall of 2023, meaning the majority of paramedics are up for renewal in October 2025. As a
reminder, SFEMSA requires all Paramedics working on an ambulance to maintain active TAD
accreditation.

Two upcoming system changes that have factored into the timeline:

•  The San Francisco EMS Agency (SFEMSA) is transitioning to an electronic certifications platform

(ImageTrend) starting with TAD and CP renewal applications.

•  The Geary Stabilization Unit (GSU) at 822 Geary is expected to be an approved TAD receiving
facility by October 1, 2025. Providers will receive training material on the site as part of the
updated 2025 TAD LMS training module.

Timeline

July 30, 2025 – SFEMSA submitted documentation to the EMS Authority for 822 Geary to become at
TAD site. The EMS Authority has 30 days to review the application and approved the associated training.

Late August 2025 – SFEMSA will release an updated training for initial and renewal TAD paramedics
after review by the state. The course is 4-hours and will be located on the SFEMSA learning platform.
The training will satisfy the state 4-hour TAD accreditation renewal requirement as well as provide
training for the new 822 Geary Stabilization Unit site. An additional announcement will be released once
the training is ready for TAD paramedics to complete. Please do not complete or re-take the currently
posted TAD training, unless you are applying as an initial TAD applicant, as you will need to take the
new training for your TAD renewal application.

September 9, 2025 – ImageTrend platform will go live for CP and TAD accreditation renewal applications
ONLY. CP and TAD renewal applications will only be accepted via ImageTrend. Paramedics will need to
claim their ImageTrend account using their Social Security Number and Date of Birth. Instructions will be

distributed later. CP and TAD paramedics will be issued e-cards upon submission of an application and
meeting all requirements. Please do not complete a TAD application in DocuSign or submit a paper
copy. You will need to resubmit in ImageTrend once the system is live.

January 1, 2026 – ImageTrend platform will go live for EMT and ALS Local Paramedic Accreditation
applications. Anyone who applies starting January 1, 2026 and/or has an expiration date of 01/31/2026
or later will be required to use ImageTrend for applications. ALS Local Paramedics will be issued e-cards.
EMTs will still receive a physical card.
