Subject: Immediate Release – Policy 4040 and Protocol 6.01

The EMS Agency considers off-cycle policy implementation very seriously and only under significant
circumstances with deliberation amongst key partners. Under LEMSA Policy 1000 – Policy and Protocol Public
Comment Process, Section IV, B, the EMS Agency may release a policy or protocol for immediate need
without a public comment process. However, this provision does require public comment at a future date.

Due to significant impacts from SB 43 implementation on local EMS Policy, Policy 4040 (Procedure and
Documentation for Non-Transported Patients) and Protocol 6.01 (Agitated/Violent Patient) are being
modified and implemented effective October 1, 2024. Only the most critical policy language changes have
been made that cannot wait for months-long policy development process. Additional extensive changes,
but not requiring immediate implementation are in process and will be forthcoming through the EMS
Advisory Committee process with anticipated implementation date of April 1, 2025. Over the past few
months, the EMS Agency has been working closely with key partners include EMS Provider leadership,
Community Paramedicine, Medical Directors, Base Hospital, Hospital Council, Department of Public Health,
law enforcement, and city attorney’s office in development of these changes.

Under Policy 1000, both immediate release policies and protocols will be posted for public comment on the
EMS Agency website. The EMS Agency remains committed to transparency and feedback. If you have any
questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the EMS Agency.

6.01 AGITATED / VIOLENT PATIENT – Immediate Release

BLS Treatment

  Assess scene safety and involve law enforcement if indicated to ensure safety.
  Attempt verbal de-escalation. Verbal de-escalation is the primary first step in managing an
agitated/violent patient. Involve caregivers. Utilize even vocal tone and be aware of body
language and threatening physical gestures.

  Consider physical restraints (4-point, soft restraints with patient in supine position) if
patient continues to represent danger to self or others and multiple de-escalation
techniques are unsuccessful.

  For placement of restraints, the minimum amount/type of restraint necessary using the

minimum amount of force.

  NPO.

  Oxygen as indicated.


If glucose <60, administer oral Glucose.

If glucose<60, administer Dextrose.


  For adults with severe agitation posing a danger to self or others and SBP > 90: administer

ALS Treatment

Midazolam.

  Do NOT use intranasal Midazolam in actively-resisting agitated patients since its degree of

absorption is unknown.

  All patients receiving medication to treat agitation must have continuous cardiac, end tidal
CO2, and pulse-oximetry monitoring and have frequent reassessment OR documentation as
to why monitoring was limited AND other non-technological assessment options that were
utilized (e.g. airway, breathing, circulation)

  Utilization of medication to treat agitation is a critical healthcare decision. The decision

shall be made by EMS personnel, not law enforcement.

6.01 AGITATED / VIOLENT PATIENT – Immediate Release

Comments

  Physical restraints must NOT be placed in such a way as to prevent evaluation of the

patient's medical status (e.g. airway, breathing, circulation), impede patient care, or harm
the patient. Circulation to extremities (distal restraints) should be evaluated frequently. If
handcuffs are applied by law enforcement, a law enforcement officer shall accompany the
patient in the ambulance.

  Patients shall not be placed, restrained, or transported in a prone position. If patient is
prone upon arrival, patient shall be placed in a supine position upon assuming care.

  For restraint procedures, see Policy 4043 – EMS Use of Physical Restraints.
  A patient can be transported to a Receiving Facility for further assessment, even if the
patient refuses treatment by prehospital providers, if the patient is placed on a 5150
involuntary hold meaning that, due to a mental health disorder or they are:

1.  a danger to self;
2.  a danger to others; and/or
3.  unable to provide for their basic personal needs for food, clothing, shelter, personal
safety, or necessary medical care due to a mental disorder or severe substance use
disorder (or both).

  A patient on an LPS conservatorship may not have capacity to refuse medical treatment.
You must review the patient’s letters of conservatorship (i.e., Court Order) to determine
whether the patient lacks capacity to make decisions regarding psychiatric treatment,
routine medical care, or necessary/non-routine medical care.

  A patient on an LPS conservatorship cannot refuse transport to a Receiving Facility without
the approval of the conservator (Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5358.5). Contact the
conservator in this situation.



  Based on the totality of the circumstances and after de-escalation steps have failed or are
likely to imminently fail, should EMS personnel directly perceive or have a reasonable
perception that the patient may become or is already presenting as agitated, violent, or
could harm or injure personnel during a physical restraint procedure, EMS Personnel must
consider calling law enforcement if law enforcement is not already on scene.
If law enforcement officers are on standby, EMS Personnel shall clearly articulate to law
enforcement officers the threat, including, but not limited to, factors showing the patient is
passively resisting or actively resisting restraints, exhibiting agitated or violent behavior, and
is a public safety risk.  Law enforcement officers will evaluate the situation and based on
their knowledge, skill, experience, training, and applicable policies and procedures, they will
determine to what extent, if any, they may assist EMS Personnel with applying restraints.

PROCEDURE and DOCUMENTATION for NON-TRANSPORTED PATIENTS –
Immediate Release

I.

PURPOSE

A.  To define who is a patient and specify the requirements for evaluation and

documentation of non-transported patients at the scene of a prehospital medical
incident.

B.  To establish performance and documentation standards for non-transport incidents,
including the assessment and release of patients who choose to decline transport or
refuse services against medical advice.

II.  DEFINITIONS

A.  Patient: A patient is defined as any individual identified by a prehospital provider:

1.  Who has requested medical assistance; or

a.  For whom medical assistance has been requested by another person; or

2.  Who a prehospital provider observes to be experiencing an apparent medical

emergency.

3.  If any uncertainty of the request for medical aid or emergency medical condition

exists, the prehospital provider will consider the individual a patient.

4.  All persons at the scene of a prehospital emergency, who meet the criteria below for
allowing self-determination, shall be allowed to make such decisions regarding their
medical care, including the refusal of evaluation, treatment and/or transport. The
criteria for allowing self-determination of medical care include:
a)  Having capacity (as defined in Section II. B.); and
b)  Being an adult (as defined in Section II. C.); or
c)  Being a pregnant minor and their only complaint is related to their pregnancy or

reproductive health.

B.  Capacity: Capacity is defined as the ability to understand, and demonstrate an
understanding of, the nature and consequences of refusing medical care.
1.  Able to rationally and logically discuss/repeat details of medical need, including

benefits, risks, and alternatives and the consequences of refusal; and

2.  Has not been declared to lack capacity to make decisions (as described in Section II

D)

C.  Adult:  Adult is defined as an individual eighteen (18) years of age or greater, or:

1.  Legally emancipated minor*;

Docusign Envelope ID: 3652DAB5-6D7F-4C71-AE22-F9D2C95DDB9D

Policy Reference No.:  4040
Effective Date:  October 1, 2024

2.  Legally married minor*;
3.  On-duty with the armed forces;
4.  Self-sufficient minor at least 15 years of age, living apart from parents, and

managing own financial affairs.
*If the legal status cannot be verified by the Prehospital Provider, SFPD should be
notified.

D.  Designated Medical Decision Maker or Authorized Legal Representative: An individual,
other than the patient, who has the legal and documented responsibility for making the
patient’s medical decisions. This individual may be:
1.  A parent or guardian of a minor;
2.  A conservator who presents letters of conservatorship from a court stating that the

patient is not competent to give or withhold consent for medical care.

a)  Letters of conservatorship are specific regarding the patient’s lack of
capacity to give or withhold consent to psychiatric treatment, routine
medical care, and necessary/non-routine medical treatment. The letter
shall match the conservatee’s name, be checked for correct timeframe
and signed/dated.  An LPS conservator is unlikely to have authority to
make non-routine medical treatment decisions, and a court order must
be sought for non-routine treatment. Emergent/life-saving treatment
may always be provided without consent from the decision-maker. An
LPS conservatee cannot refuse transport to a Receiving Facility without
the approval of the conservator (Welfare and Institutions Code §
5358.5). Patients may appear to have decision-making capacity but
have been legally declared incompetent. Prehospital personnel should
contact the conservator when encountering patients known to be
conserved. If the court order is silent on a relevant issue, and/or
prehospital personnel cannot get a hold of the conservator, contact the
Base Hospital.

3.  An attorney -in-fact appointed under a durable power of attorney for health care;
4.  In the absence of any of the above in no. 1-3, the patient’s surrogate decision-maker

with Base Hospital consultation.

E.  Gravely disabled: A condition in which a patient, as a result of a mental health disorder,
impairment by chronic alcoholism, severe substance use disorder, or a co-occurring
mental health disorder and severe substance use disorder is unable to provide for their
basic needs for food, clothing, shelter, personal safety, or necessary medical care.

F.  Psychiatric/5150 Involuntary Hold: A patient who is involuntarily detained and

transported for evaluation under the authority of Welfare and Institutions Code (e.g. §
5150, § 5585 [minors]) because as a result of a mental health disorder, the patient is a
danger to themselves, danger to others, and/or gravely disabled. A law enforcement

officer or a provider authorized by the DPH Director of Behavioral Health may detain an
individual and place them, using an authorized written application, on an involuntary
hold for up to 72 hours for assessment, evaluation, and crisis intervention or placement
for evaluation and treatment. The document must accompany the patient to the facility
that they are transported to for further assessment.

G.  Routine Medical Treatment: Includes, but is not limited to, diagnostic tests, physical

exams, and wound care.

III.

D.  Patient Decision-Making Capacity and Self-Determination for Treatment Purposes

Docusign Envelope ID: 3652DAB5-6D7F-4C71-AE22-F9D2C95DDB9D

Policy Reference No.:  4040
Effective Date:  October 1, 2024

1.  The law presumes an individual has capacity to consent to refuse care. The party

alleging a lack of capacity has the legal burden of proving it. The mere presence of a
psychiatric illness, drug and/or alcohol use, or physical/mental impairment may
impair patient decision-making capacity but are not sufficient on their own to
eliminate decision-making capacity.

2.  Any patient who presents with one or more of the following conditions shall be
considered as lacking decision-making capacity, in the opinion of the prehospital
provider, regarding refusal of medical care. When safe to do so, the individual shall
be transported to the appropriate Receiving Facility for further evaluation. (Patient
consent in these circumstances is implied, meaning that a reasonable and
competent adult would allow the appropriate medical treatment under similar
circumstances):
a)  Altered mental status. Causes of altered mental status may include, but not

limited to:

i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

v.
vi.

Abnormal vital signs
Influence of drugs and/or alcohol
Psychiatric illness
Metabolic or infectious causes (e.g. CNS infection or
hypoglycemia)
Dementia
Head trauma

b)  Minors (as defined above) with no parent or legal guardian available;
c)  Legally incompetent adult without legal guardian or DPOA available;
d)  Patients who are conserved (under a probate or LPS, temporary, or permanent
conservatorship) may have capacity to make certain health care decisions.

1)  The prehospital provider must review the Letters of Conservatorship to

determine whether the person lacks capacity to make decisions regarding
psychiatric treatment, routine medical treatment, or necessary/non-
routine treatment. Emergent/life-saving treatment may always be
provided without consent from the conservator. Non-emergent
treatment may qualify as routine or non-routine medical treatment,
depending on the treatment. See Section II for definitions.

2)  An LPS conservatee cannot refuse transport to a Receiving Facility

without the approval of the conservator (Welfare and Institutions Code §
5358.5).

e)  If special circumstances or uncertainty exists as to the presence of one of the
above conditions and patient decision-making capacity is thought to be intact,
the base hospital may be contacted for consultation and recommendations.

E. 5150 Involuntary Holds

Policy Reference No.:  4040
Effective Date:  October 1, 2024

1.  Patients who as a result of a mental disorder have been determined to be a danger
to themselves, danger to others, or are gravely disabled, and are refusing voluntary
transport must be placed on a 5150 involuntary hold in order to transport them to a
Receiving Facility for further assessment and treatment or placement for evaluation
and treatment. Any person who wants to be transported who has expressed danger
to self, danger to others, or are gravely disabled but has not received an assessment
for 5150 hold criteria, you may transport them without a 5150 hold.

2.  Patients who are detained under a 5150 involuntary hold by law enforcement or an
authorized prehospital provider can refuse non-emergent medical treatment.
3.  Pre-hospital providers have authority to transport patients to a Receiving Facility

detained on a 5150 involuntary hold for assessment, evaluation, and crisis
intervention or placement for evaluation and treatment to an authorized facility,
even if the patient refuses treatment or refuses transport.

4.  Patients who are on an LPS Conservatorship (temporary or permanent pursuant to
Welfare and Institutions Code § 5350 or § 5352.1) are on an involuntary hold and
can be transported to a Receiving Facility, even if the patient refuses treatment or
refuses transport. Contact the Conservator in these situations.

IV.

PATIENT RELEASE AND NON-TRANSPORT PROCESS

A.  Patient Refusals with Minor Medical Conditions – Patient Declines Transport (PDT)

1.  Patients who meet self-determination criteria and who have been evaluated by a
paramedic and determined to have a minor medical condition that requires
prehospital care and/or transportation to an Emergency Department may request a
release from further treatment and transport to an Emergency Department only
after being advised of the following:
a)  That Advanced Life Support (ALS) assessment is available and being offered; and
b)  That ambulance transportation to an Emergency Department and prehospital

care are available and being offered; and

c)  The nature of the condition and the risks associated with refusal of prehospital

APPENDIX 3: Prehospital Personnel Resources for Patient Management

Policy Reference No.:  4040
Effective Date:  November 1, 2022
Safety is paramount for our EMS crews and patients. To determine the best approach to ensure both the needs of the patient are met and the
resources prehospital personnel may need to provide patient care safely, consider the following steps and actions when evaluating each call or
scenario.  This is not a comprehensive list of steps for all circumstances and is listed in no particular order.  EMS clinicians shall use sound clinical
judgment and scene management skills.
Steps:
Ensure Provider
Safety and Scene
Security

Notes:
Scene safety is paramount for EMS crews and patients. If the scene cannot be made safe or the
scene becomes unsafe, then document, in detail, what was not safe about the scene and what
steps were taken to try to mitigate scene safety. Document what happened to the patient prior
to leaving a scene. Employ the following options to best mitigate safety concerns:

Call Community
Paramedic
Captain (e.g.
EMS6, CP5, CP7)

Request the appropriate Community Paramedic Captain to the scene to assist. The Captain can
consult and decide if it is an appropriate response for Street Crisis Response Team or Street
Wellness Response Team and/or respond to the scene directly. A member of the unit may have
specialized training to assist with a patient especially if there are medical, behavioral health, or
social needs. The Community Paramedic team may be able to develop a back-up strategy such as
re-engaging with the patient a few hours later or offering other social resources.

Documentation  Write a full Patient Care Report (PCR), even if a first response form would be indicated. Include

which of the steps in this Appendix 3 were taken, why the steps were taken, and the outcome of
each step. If a step did not apply to the situation or was not taken, document the rationale.
Document quotes from individuals on scene. Any phone calls/radio communications to dispatch,
physicians, and supervisors should be on a recorded line if possible.
