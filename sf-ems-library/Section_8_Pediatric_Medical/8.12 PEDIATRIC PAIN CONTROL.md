8.12 PEDIATRIC PAIN CONTROL

•  Fentanyl, Ketamine, and/or Midazolam may act synergistically to cause respiratory

depression and should not be combined unless seizures or other indications for Midazolam
use is present. Contact Base Hospital MD for consultation if needed for this combined use.

•

If utilizing 2 or more doses of Fentanyl, Ketamine, and/or Midazolam, patient shall be
placed on continuous end tidal CO2 monitoring. A trend of increasing EtCO2 readings (2 or
more readings, 10% or more, above baseline) indicates the need for immediate
re-assessment of patient’s respiratory status to include rate and depth of respirations.
Ventilatory support should be provided as necessary to return EtCO2 to baseline.

•  All injectable pain medications shall be cross-checked with a Paramedic (secondarily an

EMT) for correct medication and dose at time of administration unless transporting in the
back of an ambulance without a second attendant.
•  ODT Ondansetron preferred for children if appropriate.
