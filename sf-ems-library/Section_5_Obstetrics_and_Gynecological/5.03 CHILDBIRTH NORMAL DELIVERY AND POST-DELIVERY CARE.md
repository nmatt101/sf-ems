Suction only if airway is obstructed. Routine suctioning only delays the onset of spontaneous
breathing, causes laryngeal spasm, and vagal bradycardia.
Delayed cord clamping allows oxygenated blood to continue to flow to infant.

Comments

 If there are concerns about need for resuscitation based on fetus’ gestational age and viability.

5.03 Childbirth: Normal Delivery and Post-Delivery Care

BLS Treatment

Assess for signs of imminent delivery: crowning, urge to push, presentation of fetal part,
contractions <2 min apart.

IF BABY IS NOT CROWNING: Assist mother into position of comfort and transport.

IF BABY IS CROWNING:

•  For mother: Oxygen PRN with goal of 94-98%.
•  Assist mother into position of comfort.
•  Prepare obstetric kit and area for delivery to prevent baby from hitting hard surface.

Have blanket/chux ready to catch baby.

•  Assess for breech presentation, prolapsed cord, nuchal cord, shoulder dystocia. If noted,

refer to Protocol 5.04 Childbirth Complications.

•  Provide minimal but stabilizing pressure on baby’s head by placing palm of hand on head.
Stabilize fetal head and mother’s perineum during delivery of head. Do NOT pull on baby’s
head. If necessary, ask mother to push again to deliver the rest of the baby.

•  Check for cord around the neck. If present, refer to Protocol 5.04 Childbirth Complications.
•  Once delivered, dry, stimulate and cover newborn for warmth (especially the head).

If newborn appears pink, warm, and vigorous, place skin to skin with the mother on abdomen
or to breast for shared body heat. Wrap mother and baby together.

•  Assess newborn, if non-vigorous or in respiratory distress proceed to Protocol 8.05 Neonatal
Resuscitation. Perform APGAR score at 1 and 5 minutes post-delivery (see scoring below).
•  Assess VS of mother post-delivery and after placenta delivers. If signs of maternal shock, see
below under Protocol 5.05 Uncontrolled Hemorrhage Before or During Labor. For cardiac
arrest of mother, see Protocol 2.04 Cardiac Arrest. Maternal CPR should be performed in
supine position with left manual uterine displacement.

•  Allow the cord to pulse for at least one minute OR until pulsing stops OR until transfer to

receiving hospital. To cut the cord, clamp cord with 2 clamps 1-2” apart and approximately 6”
from newborn and cut cord between clamps. If the cord interferes with newborn
resuscitation, cut the cord immediately.

•  The placenta may deliver spontaneously. Never pull on the cord. Save all available parts for
inspection at hospital. Do not delay transport for delivery of placenta. Transport placenta in
biohazard bag to hospital.
If bleeding persists after delivery of placenta, rub abdomen below navel with flat hand x 15
seconds PRN (uterine massage). As uterus contracts, it should feel like a firm grapefruit and
bleeding should slow. Refer to Protocol 5.06 Postpartum Hemorrhage.

ALS Treatment

See below for specific ALS treatment of delivery complications.

In cases of maternal request for pain control in the setting of severe pain

•  Fentanyl can be used for pain control in this population.

5.03 Childbirth: Normal Delivery and Post-Delivery Care

birth is imminent (crowning).

•  Ketorolac is contraindicated in pregnancy/labor.

Comments

•  Suction only if airway is obstructed. Routine suctioning only delays the onset of spontaneous

breathing and causes laryngeal spasm and vagal bradycardia.

•  Delayed cord clamping allows oxygenated blood to continue to flow to infant.

•  The first priority in childbirth is assisting the mother with delivery of the child. The mother’s
physical and emotional comfort will affect the outcome. Dim lights, quiet, reducing number
of providers and keeping mother’s companions nearby may be helpful.

•  Newborn hypothermia can occur within minutes and can increase mortality. Keep the baby
on the mother’s belly skin to skin until the cord is clamped. If continued access to the infant
is necessary (e.g., for positive pressure ventilation) keep the baby warm including the use of
warmed blankets or radiant warmer if available).

•  Never pull on the cord, as it can tear.
•  The placenta may not deliver for up to 30 min, do not delay transport for placental delivery
