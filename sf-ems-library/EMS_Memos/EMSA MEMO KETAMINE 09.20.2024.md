Subject: Immediate Release – Ketamine Administration

The purpose of this memo is to provide clarity on the administration on Ketamine in the prehospital
setting.  Beginning October 1, 2024, the San Francisco EMS Agency is adding Ketamine to the approved
list of medications. Protocol 14.1-Ketamine allows for the administration of this medication for
treatment of pain only.

In certain cases, base hospital physicians are allowed to order administration of medications for
different dosing or indications than listed on the protocol, if within EMS scope of practice. For the
purpose of the October 1, 2024 protocol updates and additions, Ketamine will not be administered or
approved for purposes other than pain (such as for sedation or agitation) regardless of the ability to
request an order from the base hospital physician. Please do not contact the base hospital for approval
of ketamine use in this manner.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the EMS Agency
