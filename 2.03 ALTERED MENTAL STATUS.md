•
•

maneuvers and administer Naloxone IN if EMT has been trained.

• Check blood glucose (if EMT has been trained).
•

If blood glucose is <60 mg/dl administer Oral Glucose with symptoms of hypoglycemia. Patient
must be conscious and have an intact gag reflex.

IV / IO of Normal Saline TKO.

•
• Check blood glucose:

ALS Treatment

o If blood glucose is <60 mg/dl administer Dextrose. Up to 25 G of D10W = Up to 250ml IV or

IO bolus. May repeat q5min based on patient response (max dose 50 grams)

•

o If blood glucose < 60 mg/dl and IV cannot be established: administer Glucagon. : 1 mg IM
If opiate overdose is suspected AND respiratory depression is present initiate BLS maneuvers
and administer Naloxone: 0.4 mg IV/IM/IO, may repeat in 5 min for continued respiratory
depression up to 2mg, or 2mg IN, may repeat in 5 min for continued respiratory depression.
