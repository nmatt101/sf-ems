2.05 ADULT AND PEDIATRIC POST-
CARDIAC ARREST or RETURN OF
SPONTANEOUS CIRCULATION (ROSC)

 Initial Stabilization Phase

•  Confirm Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) with full set of vital signs.

  If signs of ROSC are present during compressions (such as an increase in EtCO2) continue

compressions until the end of the current cycle before assessing for a pulse.

•  Cycle blood pressure every 2 minutes.

•  Continue close monitoring and be prepared for re-arrest during the post-ROSC phase of care

•  Do not remove AED/Defibrillator pads if possible. Monitor pulse closely
•

If LUCAS is being utilized, pause device and raise the suction cup to obtain 12 lead ECG
Do not remove the device completely.

•  Advanced airway if not already inserted and there is no airway obstruction and patient has inadequate

respirations.

•  Oxygen as indicated and maintain SP02 92-98% (Adult) and 94-99% (Pediatric).
•  Assist spontaneous respirations with BVM. Do not hyperventilate. Attach continuous EtCO2 if not

previously attached. Titrate ventilations to target EtCO2 of 35-45 mmHg

  Adults: ventilate at a rate of 1 breath every 6 seconds (10 breaths per minute)
  Children: ventilate at a rate of 1 breath every 5 seconds (12 breaths per minute)
  Infants: ventilate at a rate of 1 breath every 3 seconds (20 breaths per minute)

•  Start IV/IO if not previously established
•  Normal Saline and/or Epinephrine infusion administration if applicable (under ALS interventions below)
•

If scene is safe, ensure ALS interventions are established, effective (i.e IV/IO and advanced airway) and
attempt to stabilize BP, HR and ventilations prior to extrication and/or transport.

•  Transmit 12 lead ECG while en-route.
•  Blood glucose level if not already obtained.
•  Maintain euthermia (97-99F)
•  Hypotension, hypoxia, and hyperventilation can decrease rates of good outcomes in patients with ROSC

Resume CPR immediately and defibrillate if in a shockable rhythm if the patient rearrests at any point in the
initial stabilization phase. Continue to assess and treat underlying causes of arrest (H’s & T’s)

ALS Interventions

•  Normal Saline fluid bolus If MAP < 65 (SBP <90)  with signs of hypoperfusion, and lungs are clear

(Protocol 2.16 Shock)

  Adult 500 ml to a MAP > 65 (SBP > 90). Maximum cumulative fluid bolus dose 1000ml
  Pediatrics: 20 ml/kg to maintain MAP and blood pressure at or above age listed in 14.IV Normal

Pediatric Vital Signs .Repeat up to 60ml/kg.

  Neonatal 10ml/kg to maintain MAP and blood pressure at or above age listed in 14.IV Normal

Pediatric Vital Signs .Repeat up to 30ml/kg

•

 If MAP <65 (SBP < 90) after fluid boluses, or signs of pulmonary edema, or the patient is considered to
have adequate volume, may administer:

 Epinephrine Infusion:

  Adults: 1-3 drops/second IV/IO using a 10 drop/ml macrodrip chamber (or available alternate)
  Pediatrics: 0.3 drops/kg/second IV/IO (0.3 mL/kg/min) using the buretrol or similar device.

•  Epinephrine infusion/Normal Saline bolus: Titrate to maintain a MAP > 65 (SBP > 90). Epinephrine infusion

may be administered in conjunction with normal saline bolus.

Comments

•  Transport all adult patients to a designated STAR center- Policy 5000-Destination
  ZSFG, CPMC Van Ness, Kaiser San Francisco, St. Mary’s, or UCSF

•  Transport all patients <18 years old to the closest critical pediatric center-Policy 5000-Destination

  CPMC Van Ness or UCSF Mission Bay

•  Elevate the head of the gurney 30 degrees if tolerated to reduce the incidence of cerebral edema,

aspiration, and ventilatory associated pneumonia

•  Worsening bradycardia may be a sign of impending re-arrest. For persistent bradycardia typically <50

BPM: Adults follow Protocol 2.07 Symptomatic Bradycardia and Protocol 7.18 Transcutaneous Pacing  (if
pacing) Pediatrics: Protocol 8.03 Pediatric Dysrhythmia: Bradycardia  and Protocol 7.18 Transcutaneous
Pacing
If patient re-arrests, follow Protocol 2.04 Cardiac Arrest or Protocol 8.07 Pediatric Cardiac Arrest and
continue to determine reversible causes (H’s & T’s)
