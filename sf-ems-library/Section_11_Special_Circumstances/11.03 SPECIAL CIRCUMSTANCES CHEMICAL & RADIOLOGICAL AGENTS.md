11.03 SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: CHEMICAL
& RADIOLOGICAL AGENTS

RADIATION INJURY

•  Burns and / or blast injury.
•  Multiple health issues with lower dose exposures.

BLS Treatment

•  Position of comfort.
•  NPO
•  Assess circulation, airway, breathing, and responsiveness.
•  Oxygen as indicated.
•  Provide Spinal Motion Restriction as indicated or position of comfort as indicated.
•  Splint suspected fractures/instability as indicated.

ALS Treatment

Comments

•  Follow facility radiation exposure plan for patient decontamination and disposal of all

•

contaminated waste.
In the nuclear bomb scenario casualty load will be excessive.  Utilize austere care protocol
and strict triaging to maximize available resources. Access all available disaster resources.

& RADIOLOGICAL AGENTS

CHEMICAL AGENT INJURY: NERVE AGENTS (e.g. VX, Sarin, Soman, Tabun)

•  Causes “SLUDGE” (Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Diaphoresis/Diarrhea, Gastric

hypermotility, Emesis/Eye (small pupils, blurry vision).

•  Severe exposures may result in decreased level of consciousness, fasciculation/muscle

weakness, paralysis, seizures.

BLS Treatment

•  Position of comfort.
•  NPO
•  Assess circulation, airway, breathing, and responsiveness.
•  Oxygen as indicated.
•  Provide Spinal Motion Restriction as indicated or position of comfort as indicated.
•  Appropriately splint suspected fractures/instability as indicated.
•  Bandage wounds/control bleeding as indicated.

•  Administer Atropine 2-5 mg IVP/IO. Repeat every 2 – 5 minutes until SLUDGE symptoms

ALS Treatment

subside.

•  For seizures: administer Midazolam.

Comments
Nerve agent poisoning can be very toxic.  Large amounts of Atropine/2-PAM may be needed to
treat symptoms.  If the patient is initially symptomatic and no response is seen to the initial
doses of medication, continue giving until a response is achieved. May need to access
pharmaceutical disaster cached called, “CHEMPACK” to have sufficient supply of antidote to
treat multiple patients.  If available, administer DuoDote [Atropine/Pralidoxime (2-PAM)]
Autoinjector IM in using dosing table below:

DuoDote (2-PAM) Dosing Estimator
DuoDote = Atropine 2.1mg / Pralidoxime 600mg

Do NOT Use
 Atropine/2-PAM
Injector

•  No signs of life
•  Fits non-

resuscitation group
(expectant) due to
other concomitant
injury

Use Between 1 – 3
 Atropine/2-PAM Injectors IM

Use 3
Atropine/2-PAM Injectors IM

Titrate dose based on 1 or more SLUDGE
signs and:
•  Elderly
•  Children appearing under age 14
•  Prolonged extrication (may require

more than 3 autoinjectors)

•  Exhibiting 2 or more SLUDGE

signs OR

•  Non-ambulatory

Bronchospasm and respiratory secretions are the best acute symptoms to monitor response to
Atropine/2-PAM therapy:

•  Decreased bronchospasm and respiratory secretions = getting better.
•  No change or increased bronchospasm and respiratory secretions = needs more 2-PAM.

Blistering agent affecting skin and mucous membranes.

MUSTARD (SULFUR MUSTARD)

BLS Treatment

•  Position of comfort.
•  NPO
•  Assess circulation, airway, breathing, and responsiveness.
•  Oxygen as indicated.
•  Provide Spinal Motion Restriction as indicated or position of comfort as indicated.
•  Appropriately splint suspected fractures/instability as indicated.
•  Bandage wounds/control bleeding as indicated.
•  Preserve body temperature if blistered area is large.

•  Advanced airway if indicated.

ALS Treatment

Comments

•  Liquid or vapor mustard penetrates the skin and mucous membranes and damages cells

within minutes of exposure, so decontamination must be done immediately after exposure.

•  Mustard agent can be very persistent; all surfaces with potential contamination must be

carefully cleaned before considered decontaminated.
