ACTION:  Electrolyte/Antiarrhythmic

MAGNESIUM SULFATE

•  Magnesium provides electrical stability in the myocardium.
•  Affects impulse formation and conduction time in myocardium reducing incidence of

dysrhythmias associated with hypomagnesemia or prolonged QT interval.

•  Magnesium is effective in the prevention and management of seizures associated with

eclampsia in pregnant people.

INDICATIONS:

•  Treatment of Torsades de Pointes (polymorphic V-Tach).
•  V-Fib/V-Tach cardiac arrest patients with poor dietary intake or at risk for hypomagnesemia

(i.e., alcohol use, renal failure, or use of diuretics).

•  Refractory V-Fib/V-Tach after use of cardioversion and amiodarone.
•

Ischemic chest pain presenting with significant ventricular ectopy AND who have poor
dietary intake or at risk for hypomagnesemia (i.e., alcohol use, renal failure, or use of
diuretics).

•  Elevated blood pressure in greater than 20 weeks gestational age or up to 6 weeks

postpartum, defined as a systolic blood pressure greater than 160 and diastolic greater than
110, and any one or more of the following severe features below.

•  Severe features include any of the following: Altered Mental Status, floaters or blurred

vision, pulmonary/peripheral edema, and severe headache.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:

•

In renal patients, use caution if giving additional doses of Magnesium sulfate.

POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:

•  Flushing and sweating
•  Bradycardia

ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:

•  Hypotension
•  Respiratory and CNS depression

•  Arrest due to Torsades de Pointes: 2 grams IV/IO push.

•  Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia WITH a pulse: 2 grams in 100 ml D5W slowly IV/IO with target

goal of infusing 100 ml over 10 minutes.

•  Eclampsia/preeclampsia with severe features: 6 grams in 100 ml in 100 ml D5W slowly IV/IO with
target goal of infusing 100 ml over 15 minutes or 10 grams IM administered as 5 grams in each
buttock if no IV access.

PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:

•  Arrest due Torsades de Pointes: 50 mg/kg IV/IO push.

•  Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia WITH a pulse: 50 mg/kg in 100ml D5W slowly IV/IO with a

target goal of infusing 100ml over 10 minutes.

NOTES:
•

In Torsades de Pointes (polymorphic V-Tach), give magnesium sulfate as the first-line antiarrhythmic
and doses higher than 2 grams may be required.
•  Contact Base Hospital Physician for additional orders.
•  Eclampsia/preeclampsia with severe features should be considered in third trimester pregnancy and
up to 6 weeks postpartum if seizures occur or a SBP greater than 160mmHg or a diastolic blood
pressure greater than 110mmHg with visual disturbances or altered mental status. History of
preeclampsia is not required for development of eclampsia.
