LIDOCAINE (Xylocaine)

ACTION:
•  Lidocaine decreases sensory nerve transmission of pain impulses.
•  Raises the ventricular fibrillation threshold and decreases the defibrillation threshold.

INDICATIONS:
•  Pain relief in IO insertion in conscious patients.
•  Cardiac arrest with V-Fib, Pulseless V-Tach present (if Amiodarone shortage)
•  V-tach with pulses (if Amiodarone shortage)

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
•  Not indicated in unconscious, unresponsive patients for IO placement.

POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
Signs of Lidocaine toxicity may include:
•  Drowsiness
•  Dizziness
•  Slurred speech

•  Altered LOC
•  Seizures
•  Respiratory arrest

ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
  Pain relief in IO insertion: 50 mg IO (2.5ml of 2% lidocaine).
  VF or Pulseless VT: 100 mg IV/IO. Repeat 100 mg IV/IO if rhythm persists. Maximum

cumulative dose is 200 mg.

  Stable/Unstable VT with pulse: 100 mg IV/IO. Repeat 100 mg IV/IO if rhythm persists.

Maximum cumulative dose is 200 mg.

PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  Pain relief in IO insertion: 0.5 mg/kg to a max dose of 50 mg IO.
  VF or Pulseless VT: 1mg/kg IV/IO with no repeat dose. Maximum dose of 100 mg

NOTES:

•  Lidocaine may be used as an alternate agent only during Amiodarone shortages
