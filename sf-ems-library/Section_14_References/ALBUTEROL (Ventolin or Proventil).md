ACTION:  Bronchodilator (beta2 adrenergic agonist)
•  Albuterol is a sympathomimetic that is selective for beta-2 adrenergic receptors resulting in

prompt bronchodilation.

•  Albuterol also reduces serum potassium levels through stimulation of beta-2 adrenergic

receptors.

INDICATIONS:
•  Reversible bronchospasm due to asthma or COPD
•  Hyperkalemia

CONTRAINDICATIONS:

•  Known hypersensitivity to the drug.
•  Use cautiously in elderly patients and patients with cardiovascular disease.
