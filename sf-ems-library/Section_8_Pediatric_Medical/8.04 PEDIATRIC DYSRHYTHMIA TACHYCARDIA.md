8.04 PEDIATRIC DYSRHYTHMIA: TACHYCARDIA

BLS

•  Place in position of comfort.
•  Assess circulation, airway, breathing, and responsiveness.
•  Obtain vital signs (see Reference 14.IV Pediatric Normal Vital Signs)
•
 Provide Oxygen as indicated, monitor and maintain 94-99% SPO2

Current Pediatric Advanced Life Support should be followed in conjunction with this
protocol/algorithm

ALS – STABLE TACHYCARDIAS
Stable patients have a pulse, normal mental status, and no signs of hypoperfusion

•  Cardiac monitor and identify rhythm
•  12 Lead ECG
•  Consider IV with Normal Saline TKO, preferably at antecubital fossa.

•  Probable Sinus Tachycardia (Narrow QRS)
Identify and treat underlying cause

o
o  Consider IV with Normal Saline

•  Probable Supraventricular Tachycardia (absent p-waves)

o  Vagal maneuvers
o  Adenosine

•  Possible Ventricular Tachycardia (regular rhythm, QRS monomorphic)

o  Consider Adenosine

ALS- UNSTABLE TACHYCARDIA
Unstable patients have a pulse but have altered mental status or signs of hypoperfusion

•  Cardiac monitor and identify rhythm
•  Consider 12 Lead ECG (do not delay therapy to obtain a 12 lead ECG)
•

Insert IO if peripheral IV cannot be established in 2 attempts, or less than 90 seconds. Do
not delay therapy for IV/IO

•  Probable supraventricular or possible ventricular tachycardia

o  Synchronized cardioversion
o  Strongly consider Midazolam prior to cardioversion. However, do NOT delay

synchronized cardioversion to start an IV/IO

QRS INTERPRETATION

Sinus Tachycardia

Comments

SVT

•  P-waves present/normal
•  Variable R-R, consistent PR
•  Rate: infant < 220 bpm.
•  Rate: child < 180 bpm.

•  P waves absent, HR not
variable. QRS < 0.09 sec.
•  Rate: infant > 220 bpm.
•  Rate: child > 180 bpm.

Ventricular Tachycardia
•  QRS duration > 0.09 sec.
•  Rate: > 120 bpm.

Vagal Maneuvers
•

Infant and preschool children: Ice cold water to face (place cold washcloth over forehead
and face without obstructing airway).

•  Older children: Valsalva maneuvers.

•  Possible causes of Sinus Tachycardia: exercise, dehydration, fever, infection, pain,

medications, anxiety

Synchronized Cardioversion: Protocol 7.19 Synchronized Cardioversion

•  Begin with 0.5-1J/kg

•

If previous cardioversion is ineffective, subsequent doses at 2J/kg

                                                                                                                                                               SAN FRANCISCO EMS AGENCY
