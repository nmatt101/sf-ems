AMIODARONE

ACTION:  Antiarrhythmic
•  Antiarrhythmic that slows conduction and lengthens the cardiac action potential resulting in

suppression of ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias.

INDICATIONS:
•  Ventricular Tachycardia (stable or unstable) and ventricular fibrillation

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
•  Sinus node dysfunction or sinus bradycardia
•  2nd or 3rd degree block
•  Known hypersensitivity from past exposure

POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
•  May prolong QT interval

•  May cause hypotension

ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
  VF or pulseless VT: 300 mg slow IVP or IO bolus. Repeat 150 mg slow IVP or IO bolus if

rhythm persists.

  Stable / Unstable VT with pulse: Inject 150 mg of Amiodarone into 100ml of D5W. Run with

target goal of infusing 100 ml over 10 minutes.

PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  VF or pulseless VT only: 5 mg/kg IVP or IO bolus. Maximum dose 300 mg.

NOTES:
•  Flush tubing with NS between dosages.
•  Signs of Amiodarone toxicity include hypotension, 3rd degree AV block and prolonged QT

interval.

•  Do not use Amiodarone in the presence of underlying atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter,

bradycardia with ventricular escape beats, or other conduction defect (2nd or 3rd degree
AV block).

•  Do not administer if patient with pulse is hypotensive. Do synchronized cardioversion.

•  Stop administration if patient becomes hypotensive during treatment.
•  Do not administer with bicarbonate in the same IV line (will precipitate).
•  When creating infusion, careful mixing is needed to avoid foaming of the medication.
•  Reconstitute Amiodarone per manufacturer’s directions.
