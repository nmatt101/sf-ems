The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) announced on Friday, January 10, 2025, that a
presumptive case of H5Nl avian bird flu has been identified in a San Francisco resident. The individual is
a child who experienced symptoms of fever and conjunctivitis but did not need to be hospitalized and
has since fully recovered. The risk to the public remains low as there is currently no evidence of
person-to-person transmission.

Symptoms of H5Nl in humans include eye redness, coughing, fatigue, fever, and headaches especially
with a known exposure to animals or recent consumption of raw dairy products. For treating known or
suspect cases, use PPE which includes respiratory protection, gloves/gown, as well as eye protection,
given the predominance of eye symptoms.

When transporting a suspect case, please ensure the Receiving Hospital is notified with an early radio
notification to ensure staff can prepare.

If you have any questions, please contact the EMS Agency or visit CDPH's website:  Bird Flu.
